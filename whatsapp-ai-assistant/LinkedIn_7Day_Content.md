## DAY 1: STAGE
### Theme: *"The Hidden Cost of Business Messaging"*

**Format:** Text post + Poll

**Post:**
```
Every business message you send is a micro-negotiation.

Think about it:

→ That client follow-up? Negotiating trust.
→ That sales email? Negotiating attention.
→ That support reply? Negotiating loyalty.

Yet most professionals spend 30+ minutes daily just deciding HOW to say something.

Not what to say. How.

• Too formal = cold, distant
• Too casual = unprofessional
• Too pushy = relationship damage
• Too soft = missed opportunity

The average professional sends 50-100 messages daily.

That's 50-100 tone decisions.
50-100 chances to get it wrong.

And here's what nobody talks about:

The cost isn't just time.
It's the deals that didn't close.
The clients who felt "something was off."
The team members who didn't understand the priority.

All because of tone.

Question for you: How much time do YOU spend crafting the "right" message?

#BusinessCommunication #SalesStrategy #Productivity #Leadership
```

**Poll:** "How long do you spend crafting important business messages?"
- Less than 2 minutes
- 2-5 minutes
- 5-15 minutes
- I overthink every one

## DAY 2: TENSION
### Theme: *"The Tone Tax Is Real"*

**Format:** Data-driven text post

**Post:**
```
I call it the "Tone Tax."

It's the hidden cost every business pays for communication inconsistency.

Here's what the data shows:

📊 60% of customers expect a response within 1 hour
📊 35% of deals die from slow or poor follow-ups
📊 73% of customers say tone affects their perception of a brand
📊 1 misinterpreted message can undo months of relationship building

But here's the real knife-in-the-side:

Your team members each have their own communication style.

→ Sarah writes formal emails. David is casual.
→ Marketing sounds warm. Sales sounds pushy.
→ Support is robotic. Leadership is vague.

Every inconsistency chips away at your brand.

And in the AI era, the problem is getting WORSE:

• AI-generated content is flooding every inbox
• Generic responses are being spotted instantly
• Authenticity is the new competitive advantage

Yet most businesses are still "winging it" on tone.

No guidelines. No training. No consistency.

Just hope that everyone "sounds right."

Hope isn't a strategy.

Tomorrow: What would it look like if you had 6 communication experts on demand?

## DAY 3: OPPORTUNITY
### Theme: *"The 6-Expert Communication Framework"*

**Format:** Carousel Document (PDF-style slides)

**Slide Content:**

| Slide | Title | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Cover | "The 6-Expert Communication Framework: Match Your Tone to Every Business Situation" |
| 2 | The Problem | "One tone doesn't fit all. A sales follow-up ≠ A support ticket ≠ An executive update" |
| 3 | Expert #1 | **THE EXECUTIVE** (Formal) - "Authoritative, concise, commanding. For board updates, legal matters, official announcements." |
| 4 | Expert #2 | **THE CONSULTANT** (Professional) - "Reliable, competent, solution-oriented. For B2B communication, client management." |
| 5 | Expert #3 | **THE FRIEND** (Friendly) - "Warm, genuine, human. For customer support, relationship building." |
| 6 | Expert #4 | **THE ADVISOR** (Sales Expert) - "Persuasive, value-focused, strategic. For lead nurturing, proposals, closing." |
| 7 | Expert #5 | **THE DIPLOMAT** (Negotiator) - "Psychological, calculated, strategic. For difficult conversations, contracts." |
| 8 | Expert #6 | **THE NATURAL** (Natural) - "Casual, authentic, conversational. For team chat, everyday communication." |
| 9 | CTA | "What if you could switch between all 6 instantly? Tomorrow: I'll show you how." |

One tone doesn't fit all.

A sales follow-up requires different energy than a support ticket.
An executive update demands different authority than a team check-in.
A negotiation needs different psychology than a client thank-you.

Yet most AI writing tools give you ONE generic tone.

That's like having one suit for every occasion.

What if you had 6 communication experts instead?

Swipe through to see the framework →

Each "expert" is designed for a specific business situation:
📋 The Executive – Authority mode
💼 The Consultant – Competence mode
😊 The Friend – Warmth mode
🎯 The Advisor – Persuasion mode
🤝 The Diplomat – Negotiation mode
💬 The Natural – Authenticity mode

Tomorrow: How to access all 6 in one tool.

## DAY 5: TRUST
### Theme: *"Why We Built This (The Builder's Story)"*

**Format:** Personal narrative post

**Post:**
```
I'm going to be honest about why we built Reple.

It wasn't because "AI is hot."
It wasn't because "there's a market opportunity."

It was because we had the problem.

Running a business means messaging all day:
• Client follow-ups
• Lead outreach
• Support tickets
• Partner discussions
• Team coordination

And every single message felt like a test.

"Did I sound professional enough for this client?"
"Was that too pushy for a first follow-up?"
"Did I come across as cold in that support reply?"

We tried templates. Too rigid.
We tried generic AI. Too... generic.
We tried "just being ourselves." Too inconsistent.

Then we asked a different question:

"What if AI could learn MULTIPLE communication styles, not just one?"

Not a generic assistant.
Six specialized experts.

→ The Executive for authority
→ The Consultant for competence
→ The Friend for warmth
→ The Advisor for persuasion
→ The Diplomat for difficult conversations
→ The Natural for everyday messaging

Each trained on distinct communication patterns.
Each available on demand.

That's Reple.

Built by people who understand message anxiety.
For people who never want to feel it again.

## DAY 6: SOCIAL PROOF
### Theme: *"The ROI of Right-Tone Communication"*

**Format:** Case study / Results post

**Post:**
```
Let's talk ROI on communication.

Here's what changes when you get tone right:

BEFORE consistent tone strategy:
• 15+ minutes per important message
• Anxiety about "did that sound right?"
• Inconsistent voice across team members
• Slow response times (message drafting bottleneck)

AFTER implementing the 6-Expert framework:
• Response time: 2-3 minutes (including review)
• Confidence in every send
• Consistent brand voice across the team
• 3x increase in message throughput

Real scenario:

A sales professional using Reple's Sales Expert mode:
→ Before: 30 lead follow-ups per day
→ After: 90 lead follow-ups per day
→ Same quality. 3x volume.

A support team using Friendly + Professional modes:
→ Before: Inconsistent tone, varied customer ratings
→ After: Standardized warmth, improved satisfaction scores

The math is simple:

If better communication saves you 30 minutes/day:
= 2.5 hours/week
= 10 hours/month
= 120 hours/year

That's 3 full work weeks recovered.

What would you do with 3 extra weeks per year?
