# Reple AI - 7 Day Reddit Content Plan

## Day 1: Productivity / Life Hack
**Subreddits:** r/productivity, r/TimeManagement, r/LifeHacks
**Title:** How I stopped wasting 2 hours a day on repetitive WhatsApp & LinkedIn replies.

**Body:**
I realized I was spending way too much time staring at my screen, thinking of "professional" ways to say simple things on WhatsApp and LinkedIn. Copy-pasting context into ChatGPT was just as slow.

So I built a browser extension that reads the last 10 messages on my screen and drafts a context-aware reply in 1 click. It's called **Reple AI**.

It has different tones (Professional, Casual, Persuasive) so I don't sound like a robot.
If anyone wants to try it, I made a free version (20 drafts/month) or you can bring your own OpenAI key for unlimited use.

Would love to know if this helps anyone else drowning in DMs!

## Day 2: The "Indie Hacker" Build
**Subreddits:** r/SideProject, r/IndieDev, r/SaaS
**Title:** I built a browser extension that "reads" your screen to draft AI replies. Here's how it works.

**Body:**
Hey everyone, I'm a solo dev. I got tired of the context-switching friction with ChatGPT.
I wanted something that lived *inside* the browser and just "knew" what was fast.

I built **Reple AI** using the Chrome Extension API to read the DOM of WhatsApp Web and LinkedIn (client-side only, no data storage). It sends the last 10 messages as prompts to the LLM and streams back a drafted reply in the tone of your choice.

The hardest part was getting the DOM selectors right for different platforms.
It supports "Bring Your Own Key" so you don't have to pay a subscription if you already have an API key.

Check it out and let me know what you think of the implementation!

## Day 3: Sales / Freelance Angle
**Subreddits:** r/sales, r/freelance, r/Upwork
**Title:** Stop losing leads because you reply too slow (or too weirdly).

**Body:**
In sales and freelancing, speed is money. But replying *too* fast often leads to typos or weird phrasing.
I built a tool called **Reple AI** to solve this for myself. It plugs into WhatsApp Web and LinkedIn.

You get a message from a lead? Click "Persuasive".
Boss asking for an update? Click "Professional".
Friend asking for plans? Click "Quick".

It reads the conversation history so the reply actually makes sense.
It's free to try (20 drafts). Hope it helps you close more deals!

## Day 4: The "Anti-Subscription" Angle
**Subreddits:** r/Frugal, r/software, r/technology
**Title:** Why pay $20/mo for writing tools? Use your own API key.

**Body:**
I hate how every AI wrapper charges a monthly subscription for something you can do cheaply with an API key.
I built **Reple AI** with a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) feature.

If you have an OpenAI or Gemini API key, you can plug it in and use my extension for free, forever. You only pay the tiny API costs directly to the provider (usually pennies).
It works on WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Slack.

Stop overpaying for wrappers!

## Day 5: Humour / Relatable (Meme-adjacent)
**Subreddits:** r/work, r/CorporateFacepalm, r/antiwork (maybe?)
**Title:** The "Corporate Clapback" button finally exists.

**Body:**
You know when you get a passive-aggressive message from a coworker and you really want to say something mean, but you need to keep your job?

I added a "Professional" tone to my AI extension, **Reple AI**.
It takes the angry thought in your head (or the context of their stupid message) and translates it into: "Per my last email..." levels of professional shade.

It also does "Friendly" and "Persuasive" if you actually like them.
Give it a try next time someone tests your patience.

## Day 6: Comparison / Technical Superiority
**Subreddits:** r/InternetIsBeautiful, r/chrome_extensions
**Title:** ChatGPT is cool, but copying context is a pain. This extension fixes that.

**Body:**
The biggest friction with using LLMs for messaging is context. You have to copy the last few messages, explain who said what, and then ask for a reply.

I automated that loop. **Reple AI** sits as a sidebar on WhatsApp/LinkedIn.
1. It scrapes the last 10 messages from the active chat.
2. It understands who is the sender and who is the receiver.
3. It generates a relevant draft in 1 click.

No more copy-pasting. It just works.
Feedback welcome!

## Day 7: Vulnerability / "Building in Public"
**Subreddits:** r/roastme (creative interpretation), r/Entrepreneur, r/startups
**Title:** I'm a 22yo dev from Pakistan building a global SaaS. Roast my product.

**Body:**
I've been pouring my nights and weekends into **Reple AI**, a context-aware communication assistant.
It's tough building something from this part of the world and trying to compete globally.

I'd love honest feedback. Is the UI intuitive? Is the "Bring Your Own Key" feature a selling point? Does the landing page explain it well?

Don't hold back. I need the tough love to improve.
