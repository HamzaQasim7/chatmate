The good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to
0:06
get better at both. It feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days. How is AI pricing different? The winners in AI will need to master
0:13
monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to
0:18
expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a raw price point, you're in trouble. 20% of what you build drives
0:24
80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often. What would you say
0:31
is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away? If you think about market share and wallet share, let's think about it as a 2x two. The quadrant that
0:37
you really want to be in is the outcomebased pricing model. The top right quadrant where you have great
0:43
autonomy and great attribution. About 5% of companies are probably in a true
0:48
outcomebased pricing model. If you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant. Do you feel like the
0:55
popular IDE startups are going to be in trouble down the road? Some of them yes without naming names.

Today my guest is Mavan Ramanujam. Mavan is the smartest person I know on pricing
1:07
and monetization strategy. As managing partner at Simon Kutcher, he's worked with over 250 companies including 30
1:14
unicorns to help them figure out how to price, package, and grow their products. He's also the author of the book on
1:20
pricing called Monetizing Innovation. And now he's back with a new book, a sequel called Scaling Innovation, which
1:26
teaches you how to architect your business for long-term profitable growth. It also how to avoid the common
1:31
traps that teams fall into that keep them from building real, durable, sustainable businesses. Bill Gurley
1:36
wrote the forward. I had a chance to read an early copy. I absolutely loved it. It's a book that every founder needs to read. And in this episode, Mavon
1:44
shares many of the biggest lessons from the book, including how pricing strategy is very different for AI companies, why
1:50
you need to get your pricing model right from the start in today's market, a very simple 2x two to help you pick your
1:56
pricing model, how to gain pricing power, a ton of tactical advice for negotiating more effectively, the most
2:02
common traps founders fall into, and so much more. If you order five copies of the book, Mavon is offering a chance to

The core thesis of Scaling Innovation
4:34
Maravan, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. It's exciting to be back, Lenny. Thanks
4:39
so much for hosting me again. This is a a very rare second visit to the podcast.
4:44
You've got a new book coming out. I've got a very early copy right here. If you're watching on YouTube, here's the
4:49
copy you sent me. It's like 200 pages. Did you print this out on your printer, by the way? Yes. I think I ran out of printer ink
4:57
after that, I guess. I appreciate the early copy. It's amazing. What we're going to be doing with this conversation is going through
5:03
some of the biggest lessons that you share in this book to give people a sense of many of the things that you share, many things you've learned since
5:09
writing the first book. Let me start with this question. Why did you decide to write another book and what is the
5:14
difference between scaling innovation which is the name of this book and monetizing innovation is the name of
5:20
their first book. So monetizing innovation, we actually wrote it 8 years ago. Time flies. Uh and the core thesis
5:26
of that book was you know how do you build products that are not just cool but are products that people need value
5:32
and are actually willing to pay for and I think that took a life of its own and over the years we kept getting another
5:38
question from entrepreneurs that hey we built a great product we know there is willingness to pay but how do we build a
5:43
great business how do we scale this and the brutal truth is that even if you have a great product you might actually
5:48
not figure out a way to grow fast and grow profitably so we wrote scaling innovation in an effort to actually
5:54
solve that puzzle. So you can think of this as a sequel to monetizing innovation and monetizing innovation
6:00
talked about how to build great products. Scaling innovation talks about how to build a great business and you
6:06
know writing a book is there needs to be a purpose for this. For me the reason for writing books is about you know
6:12
giving a bit back based on what I know to like founders and bookw writing is hard. Writing a good book is even
6:18
harder. And just like uh monetizing innovation, scaling innovation is not,
6:23
you know, marketing fluff. It actually has real actionable stuff packed in that you can go on Monday morning and start
6:30
implementing. And uh we wrote this book to give back a bit of what we know and to help companies scale and architect
6:36
towards profitable growth. I love people like you that do the work for I don't
6:42
know decades at this point learn from real life experiences over and over and
6:48
over and then just share all this stuff with people like this is the most the highest ROI way to learn is uh letting
6:55
you do all this work to learn all these things and then you share all your answers with us. So that's that's why I love these books. If you had to boil
7:01
down the thesis of this book into just like a simple thought so that we can just start to plant this in founders's
7:06
heads, what would what would that be? So if I have to boil down the core thesis of the book, it is basically that if you
7:13
want to build an enduring business, you need to be able to architect towards profitable growth. What that means is
7:20
you need to be able to master two engines, market share and wallet share.
7:26
It sounds simple on the surface, but it's actually quite complex because if you unpack that for gaining market share
7:32
and wallet share, you need to be good at acquisition, monetization, and retention as in get customers, make an initial
7:40
money on them, but also make money on an ongoing basis and have your customers actually refer more customers. Many
7:47
companies actually what they do is they focus on a single engine strategy. So they focus on one of those two topics
7:53
and pretty much exclude the other one. That leads to all kinds of situations. You see companies saying I'll grow at
7:59
all costs and postpone monetization. You see some who would say you know I'm going to monetize earlier on but they
8:05
might miss out on acquisition opportunities or yet others who are so focused on a small set of loyal customer
8:12
base that they're neither monetizing nor are they actually acquiring. So to to
8:18
the good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to
8:24
get better at both. But this does not mean that you're putting equal effort on market share and wallet share at all
8:31
given points in time. But it means you're putting equal attention on both those topics and being thoughtful about
8:38
the trade-offs and saying how can I actually look at these two topics together so that I'm architecting
8:44
towards profitable growth. That's the core thesis of the book. We actually showcase nine strategies that actually
8:50
allow companies uh you know to architect towards profitable growth. And every chapter ends with how this particular
8:57
strategy uh you know circumvents a single engine problem and helps you you know focus on market share and wallet
9:04
share at the same time. And there's also CEO questions and leadership questions that people should reflect on when they
9:10
architect towards profitable growth and are they on the right track? I mean think of it this way. If you're flying
9:15
a, you know, aircraft, you don't want to fly it on one engine. Why do you actually want to do that for your business? Okay. So, I imagine many
Common traps founders fall into
9:23
founders or people thinking about starting a company are are not feeling like they are in one bucket or another.
9:30
There's like intuitively you're not like, "Oh, of course, we're going to just focus on growth forever and that's all that matters." You had these kind of
9:36
traps that founders fall into that you referenced a bit. Can you just talk again about just like the common traps
9:42
you find founders fall into that uh people may recognize like that's what I'm doing probably. So let's unpack the traps that are
9:50
correlated to the archetypes. So if you're a you know disruptor archetype
9:55
you might fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might land but you might not expand as in in your eagerness
10:02
for like acquiring you might have actually given away a lot at less and you have given the farm away but you
10:08
don't have anything to expand to. That's the first trap you're likely to fall into. The second trap that you actually
10:13
fall into is you start uh you know a market share that is one is different from a market share that is actually
10:20
held. If you're so acquisition focused, you're actually focused on getting more and more customers, but you're not
10:26
spending enough time with customers that you actually got to keep them, upsell them, you know, keep them happy, etc.
10:32
So, you might fall into that trap. If you're a money maker, you fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might
10:38
nickel and dime your customers to death. You know, because you're focused on monetization, you might come up with a,
10:44
you know, very differentiated pricing model, different levers, hidden fees, things to charge for, you know, many
10:49
different things. and come across as just trying to nickel and dime your customer. The second trap that a money
10:55
maker actually falls into is that you know you fall into the price premium paradox where you you you think that
11:02
pricing high actually indicates value but you priced it so high that you actually start you know hurting your
11:08
acquisition. So it is it is just becomes irrelevant for most people. If you're in the community builder you actually fall
11:15
into like two common traps. The first one is you're focused so much on the you know foundation that you actually miss
11:21
the frontier which is you're so focused on your loyal customer base that you forget forget to like attract you know
11:28
different types of customers and you're not acquiring. And the second trap that you fall into if you're a community
11:33
builder is you know you train your customers to expect more for less because you're so eager to satisfy your
11:39
loyal base. You start giving them more and more and you're training your best customer base to expect more for less.
11:46
So these six traps are very common across these archetypes. Being a profitable growth architect means that
11:53
you're avoiding these traps and you're in in other words, you're simultaneously being a disruptor, a money maker, and a
11:59
community builder all at the same time. And how do you actually have that archetype and the right strategies to
12:05
actually go about your business? Okay, so this is what you want to not do. You mentioned you have nine strategies for how you actually want to
Beautifully simple pricing
12:12
approach pricing, monetization, scaling, monetization and innovation. Can you
12:17
share a couple of these strategies, maybe two or three, maybe some of your favorites? Sure. So I will unpack a couple of uh
12:23
you know strategies. Maybe the first one I would take is what we call as beautifully simple pricing. So in your
12:30
early days, it is by far more important to have pricing that is really simple and is not creating too much friction in
12:37
the sales conversation. I mean the asset test that you probably should go back on Monday morning and do is take some of
12:43
your early prospects or customers and ask them to articulate the pricing strategy back to you. Right? If they
12:50
were to actually sell on your behalf, how would they describe the pricing strategy? And if they cannot you know
12:55
contextualize that in a simple manner and actually explain you don't have a simple pricing strategy. It's as simple
13:01
as that. And having a simple pricing strategy also means that you know your pricing needs to be able to tell a value
13:09
story as in you need to contextualize your price based on the value that you actually bring to the table. A great
13:15
example here is you know superhuman when they started they were actually competing with like you know free email
13:21
products and they were coming up with a premium email experience and how do you actually price that and I thought the
13:26
team at Rahul with the team at superhuman with Rahul and others did a pretty good job they came up with a $30
13:33
price point per month which was pretty simple but the way they kind of told the story was that you know you pay a dollar
13:39
a day for actually getting four hours of productivity back in the week and then suddenly the pricing doesn't look too
13:45
off. I mean, it's like the price for a latte in a week to actually get four hours back. Why wouldn't I actually do that, right? And pricing
13:52
contextualization and value story doesn't need to just apply for premium products. If you take another example
13:57
like the Subway $5 footong is a different way to say a story with pricing that oh for a $5 you get a lot
14:03
of value actually back, right? So beautifully simple pricing really means coming up with a simple pricing strategy
14:10
that your customers immediately get and your pricing is actually telling a value story. And how do you actually get that?
14:17
So in the book we have a checklist of 10 different things that you actually need to look at to make sure that your
14:23
pricing is beautifully simple. As we go through these strategies, is your advice try all these things like you should do
14:29
as many of these strategies as you can or is it maybe pick a few that work for you or just one is enough? So there are
14:35
nine strategies. We have organized that into strategies that apply during your startup phase like the just just when
14:41
you get started and strategies that apply to you in your scaleup phase. So there are four strategies that you need
14:47
to do in your startup and five in the scaleup. So it's quite manageable. I would argue that all four apply in the
14:53
startup and all five actually apply in the scaleup phase. But it's not like you need to start focusing on nine things
14:58
from day one. So this first one was was the startup phase. Yeah. The beautifully simple pricing is the startup. Exactly. And so in the
Mastering negotiations
15:05
scaleup phase, I think the one of the most important strategies is to like, you know, master negotiations and really
15:12
get uh better at acing negotiations, right? Especially if you're in a B2B situation. And how do you actually do
15:19
that? Because you need to be able to talk about the value and contextualize your price based on those kind of
15:24
conversations. So to master negotiations, it comes down to actually three things. mastering gives and gets,
15:31
being good at value selling, and third having the right negotiation strategies.
15:37
So, let's unpack that each at a time. So, giving and getting, why is that important? Because in a negotiation, you
15:43
know, typically you're giving, I mean, you're giving concessions, people are asking. If you don't get anything back,
15:48
you're basically indicating to the other person that they can keep beating you up and you can, you know, you you need to
15:53
keep giving. But if if you're giving something but you ask for something in exchange, then you're basically bringing
16:00
authenticity into the negotiation because it actually means something you to you to give. So you're asking
16:05
something back. It actually makes the negotiation way more effective. And you
16:10
know in the book we actually talk about the top 10 gets in B2B and the top 10 gets in B2C. One of my favorite gets in
16:17
the B2B situation is what I call as conducting a value audit. So what this
16:22
means is if you're giving a concession ask for a value audit and exchange where every 6 months you know a team
16:29
internally from your customers would be commissioned to actually conduct a value assessment of your products so that it
16:36
becomes their business case and you co-create it with them saying how much value is actually produced and this is
16:42
great because if they actually engage in that that gives you tremendous pricing power for like renegotiations because it
16:48
is their business case they champion it internally and you're pretty much making your products pretty sticky. So it's a
16:54
pretty harmless debt, but it could be very powerful for like you know future negotiations. So being good at gives and
17:01
gets is Thank you. for being good at gives and gets is really you know
17:06
critical. The second thing in mastering negotiations is being good at value selling. And for being good at value
17:12
selling you need to do three things. First you need to be able to like create the needs. Second you need to be able to
17:19
create affirmation loops. And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And let's talk about each of those. So
17:25
creating needs is very important because you know many uh founders show up and try to understand what are the needs of
17:31
the customers. That's one way to look at it. But you need to be able to create needs rather than just discover them
17:37
right. So like for instance if you're a you know marketing automation AI product
17:42
and uh you know you you save like let's say three weeks of like work that actually needs to be done to actually
17:48
get stuff in a dashboard that can be analyzed by marketing managers. The way you create the need is ask about
17:54
existing processes and say okay so just so I understand all of this stuff actually takes you three weeks to like
18:01
put data together to actually have meaningful dashboards for your you know marketing managers to you know take
18:06
action. What if that was available to you instantaneously? Oh, you have now just created a need.
18:12
Right? So, be in that mindset of creating a need as opposed to just discovering them. The second thing is,
18:18
you know, creating affirmation loops. And this is really important. I've seen a lot of founders get into negotiations.
18:24
They're so eager to talk about their products. They keep talking about the products without any affirmation from the other side. You need to pass and
18:31
create affirmation loops. Things like for instance, okay, so far you have seen all of this. How does this actually uh
18:38
you know play out in your company? Do you see it as valuable? What about this dashboard you actually like? So when you
18:44
ask these kind of questions and your customers are playing back the value that they actually see in your product,
18:50
you're creating affirmation loops which become tremendously useful when you start selling the product finally
18:56
because if they've agreed that there's value that is being produced then you also have a better commercial
19:02
discussion. And the third one is, you know, creating a good ROI model. And, you know, I see a lot of founders work
19:09
on a P and after the P is over, they'll show up with an ROI model and try to defend a price. You've already lost the
19:15
battle. I mean, no one is going to believe an ROI model that you just cooked up. Everyone is going to challenge you on assumptions. the the
19:22
right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one which means you
19:29
know agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs. So like hey how long does this process take today?
19:36
How many engineers are there? So you create ask questions that are all inputs to an ROI model and if you have done
19:42
that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs they are very unlikely to
19:48
push back on the output of an ROI model. So a P needs to be framed as the purpose
19:54
of a P is to build a business case and we are going to co-create an ROI model with the customer as opposed to it being
20:01
a you know tech and product functionality feature test and you show up with an ROI model and when you're
20:06
building an ROI model there are many buckets to focus on but the there are three that are very critical. The first
20:13
one is you know what are the incremental gains that you actually bring to the table based on KPIs and metrics that
20:21
your customer is tracking. So this could be things like incremental revenue, reduction in churn. These are the
20:26
immediate tangible clear impact to the business line based on the products that you actually bring to the table. The
20:33
second bucket is you know cost savings. Are you reducing headcount? Are you reducing license costs? Like what are
20:39
the tangible cost savings? And the third one which is often overlooked is opportunity cost. For instance, if you
20:45
save you know 10 hours of time for like a team, what do they actually do with that 10 hours? That can also be
20:51
quantified. So when you put all of these three things together, you start building a proper ROI model that you can
20:58
actually use in your value selling to defend the right price. And the so we
21:03
talked about three steps in mastering negotiations. The first one was gives and gets. The second one was you know
21:08
getting better at value selling. The third one is actually getting better at even negotiations and what strategies
21:14
would you actually use and there are a couple of uh you know strategies that we have found to be really uh productive.
21:20
The first one is to show up with options. You know many many founders uh
21:26
rush with like one product and one price and say okay this is a 100k product and that's what we're trying to sell.
21:32
Inevitably what will happen is the you know the immediate focus of the conversation will be on the price and
21:37
you're only talking about price. But if you have options on the table, let's say if you have a, you know, good, better,
21:43
best. If you have 100k product, a 200k and a 300k option, then you're not just talking price, you're talking value.
21:49
Because if your customer is budget conscious, they'd say, hey, I like the 100k price point, but I actually like
21:55
the functionality in your 200k product. Then your immediate question is, what in the functionality do you actually like?
22:01
Why is that beneficial for you? So you switch the conversation back to like, you know, value as opposed to just
22:07
talking about price. And we have seen that with these kind of conversations, you're by far more better off to
22:13
actually land in a much better place than just showcasing one product and one price. And and showcasing options
22:19
doesn't need to be just different products. It could even be a pricing model choice. And I'd probably give a,
22:26
you know, simple hack that people can try on Monday morning. Um, you know, I was talking to this founder who said,
22:32
"Hey, I think uh I think the budget is about 100K. Um that's what I believe
22:37
from the key stakeholder. But my product really brings crazy value. It I could
22:43
even charge let's say a 500k for this product but I don't have the courage to actually go and ask for a 500k uh you
22:50
know price because I kind of know 100k is the budget. What should I do? Right? So for those kind of situations actually
22:56
show up with options in your pricing model. So I we we coached him to like go in with a 100K plus 10% on any
23:04
incremental value that you bring or it's a 500k fixed. So now this is actually a
23:09
great situation in negotiation because if you're price sensitive, you're focused on the 100k. It's a you know
23:14
small fee to actually get started but the conversation would gravitate towards what is that 10%? How do you measure
23:20
value? That's a great conversation to have because now you're talking about how you add value, where's the value
23:26
generation, what portion would you take and you know you see one of two situations. Either the customer would
23:32
say that's great, you're putting skin in the game, let's go with 100k and 10%. Or 80% of the situations you might actually
23:38
want to avoid the outcome based pricing as a buyer, but you're not really fixated on the 500k at that point. It is
23:45
the premium that you're actually paying for like the certaintity. So no one is focusing on the 500k because there's a
23:50
100k option on the table and you just put a 500k and got the courage to do that and in this specific situation that
23:56
500k got negotiated to 400k and they just forex the deal compared to where they would be. Right? So having options
24:02
on the table when you negotiate is critical and there's also some tactics that we showcase in the book like
24:08
anchoring is important. If you start high you will also end up higher. But the and also tapering concessions like
24:14
how do you give concessions? I mean the worst negotiators will start by giving you know a small concession and then
24:20
they give a bit more when someone asks like you might give a 5% discount and the procurement guy says that's not
24:26
enough. Okay, I'll give you 10% more. Okay, that's not enough. I'll give you 15. What are you indicating to the other
24:31
person? You're just basically indicating that I can keep beating you up and I can get more discounts. The best negotiators
24:37
who taper the concessions so they would say I can give you 15%. Okay, I need more. I'll give you five. I need more.
24:43
I'll give you two. So you're automatically indicating to the other person that the negotiation is actually ending. Right? So how do you taper
24:49
concessions also become important. So when you put all of these three things together, if you master your gives and
24:54
gets, you get better at value selling and you use the right negotiation strategy, you can extract full value
25:00
from every deal. That's probably way more important when you're in the scaleup phase. This is such great advice. I love that
25:08
this is just one small chapter of your book. Like this could make or break your company. It's interesting that you have
25:14
a whole thing on negotiation in a book about uh scaling innovation and growing
25:20
your company. Is the assumption here that your pricing and monetization is so impacted by how well you negotiate
25:25
because that changes your entire pricing structure and how much you're making. Is that why you put so much effort into this part?
25:31
Exactly. I mean in a B2B situation you can set all the pricing you want, come up with great pricing models, but at
25:37
least even today it's a human having a human conversation trying to negotiate. So if you cannot contextualize you know
25:43
what you put on the table, how do you negotiate around value? You know how do you contextualize your price? You're
25:48
leaving a lot of money on the table. So to us negotiations is yet another monetization topic where you're thinking
25:55
about it as extracting full value from every deal. And this is not just uh you know negotiation tactics like you know
26:01
keep your boss at home and just negotiate and things like that. There's actual negotiation strategies that are
26:07
rooted on value selling gives and gets and focusing on extracting full value
26:13
from every deal. So useful this idea of throwing out a third like higher priced option say 500k. It's so interesting
26:20
because usually the advice I hear is like just throw out twice the number you used to throw out. Just like put it out
26:25
there just in case which is really scary, right? To ask for like what about $50,000? And this is like a much less
26:32
scary way of doing that. Okay, but we also have this 500k option. Here's what you get. And then they may be like, "Oh,
26:38
that's exactly what we want." And you're like, "Oh, wow. It worked." Exactly. It's a very simple hack to get your courage.
26:43
That is a good price point. Wow. Uh this is awesome. This is just like a a golden nugget within golden
26:49
nuggets of of advice. Okay. So, you have nine strategies. We've covered two. Let's not get into them, but just what
Other strategies for effective pricing and monetization
26:55
are a few more just so people know what else they might be able to learn. Sure. We talk about how to uh you know
27:01
land and expand as in how to design your best free product in such a way that you're landing but also expanding. We
27:09
talk about things like how to have the right packaging strategy. You know how to stop churn before it happens. How to
27:15
do price increases effectively because at some point in your scaleup journey you need to increase price but how do
27:20
you do that in a meaningful uh you know fashion. So we have you know various strategies that apply both for the
27:27
startup and the scaleup phase but in combination all of those things help you articulate uh and architect towards
27:34
profitable growth. Awesome. Okay let's talk about AI for a bit. A lot of your book is about how AI pricing is very
How AI pricing is different
27:40
different from other previous traditional pricing strategies and it feels like every company wants to be an
27:46
AI company these days. So I think this is going to apply to a lot of people. How is AI pricing different? Yeah, AI
27:52
pricing is very different from the previous uh you know vintage of companies. Why is that so? Because AI
27:58
founders need to tackle monetization from the very early days like day one in their seat stage preede uh kind of thing
28:05
which was not probably the focus for you know the previous SAS companies. Why is that so? Because of two reasons. One
28:12
there's for the first time there's cost dynamics to actually navigate. So you need to think about monetization from
28:17
day one. But there's also a more critical reason which is value capture. Because with AI products, you're
28:24
actually bringing a lot of value to the table. And if you don't capture that from day one, then you're training your
28:29
customers to expect more for less. So for instance, think about this. If you're building a, you know, aentic AI
28:35
uh product that taps into labor budgets, labor budgets are 10x compared to software budgets. So if you use all the
28:42
old playbooks then you're under monetizing again from day one and and training your customers to expect more
28:48
for less. So how do you come up with you know foundational models that actually allow you to like capture the value that
28:54
you bring to the table. And why has this become critical? Because you know with AI finally founders can you know really
29:01
solve the attribution problem. In the previous vintages like for instance if you take slack you can say that the
29:08
productivity went up efficiency happened but you cannot measure it monitor it attribute it to slack okay that's
29:14
probably why they were in a seedbased pricing you know pricing model but in today's situations you see companies
29:19
that say in a fortune company I was able to improve throughput by 10% reduce
29:25
scrap by 5% and when you get into those kind of situation where an AI is creating core value and is attributable
29:32
to the AI right? You get a lot of pricing power. So the two questions that we commonly hear from you know AI
29:39
founders is how do I set the right pricing model as in how do I charge which becomes you know way more
29:46
important than how much you charge because the underlining business model has changed. It is not we have moved
29:53
from you know software being a you know pay for access to like now you're paying
29:58
for work delivered. So like the monetization models become key. That is the first question that people actually
30:05
ask us. The second one is you know how do I navigate PC's commercial discussions early because the buyer on
30:12
the other side also wants to see the value before they engage in a commercial discussion. So those two topics become
30:19
very critical and we have showcased a lot of this in the book. This episode is brought to you by Persona, the adaptable

Handling POCs
31:34
Let's talk about this PC piece because I think this is something a lot of people deal with and then I want to talk about this 2 by two that you have in the book
31:40
and I'll I'll actually pull it up. So, let's talk about PC's first. So PC's uh you know when we talk about PC's many
31:47
founders think about a PC as a proof of technical functionality and is their
31:54
product actually working in like their customer environments and they set up the expectation that way saying hey
31:59
we're going to put the product and we are going to see if it actually works and and they would probably say should I
32:06
charge for a P versus not and we will unpack that in a bit should you or should you not and the that's actually a
32:12
completely wrong way of framing it. The P should be framed as the entire goal of the P is to create a business case.
32:19
Period. Full stop. It is not to like demonstrate you know product functionality fit within your customer
32:25
environments ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case. So if you frame it this
32:31
way is you can say look it is a 30-day pilot for cocreating an ROI model and
32:37
building a business case along with your users. If we see value at the end of the 30 days based on the business case, we
32:43
can get to commercial discussions. So that way you have actually not talked about your price. You're only focused on
32:49
co-creating a business case with the customer and based on the business case you can actually come up with, you know,
32:55
a proper commercial agreement and if they see value, they're going to pay you for it. Right? So thinking about the
33:00
PC's in that kind of manner and uh you know the question that I often get asked is should I charge for a PC?
33:08
And the answer is uh yes, but smartly. Um let's talk about why it's important
33:14
to charge. Uh the reason you need to charge for a P is you start isolating
33:20
people who are just tire kickers versus serious buyers. It becomes a lead qualification mechanism. If you didn't
33:25
have that, you're going to attract all of these curious buyers who just curious about the AI. They just want to see if
33:31
it works or not. They will say yes, I'll engage with the P. They will take 30, 60, 90 days with you. They will burn a
33:36
lot of resources. Never buy. you've just wasted your time. Time is of the essence. So like having a price tag to
33:43
your PC actually indicates that you know there is seriousness on both sides. So you should charge. But how do you
33:49
actually charge for it? You need to charge for it smartly. Um what this means is that you need to make sure that
33:56
your PC pricing is not a reflection of your actual commercial deal. Because
34:01
let's say if you just say it's a 10k P for like a 30-day pilot, if you don't talk about the fact that it is not the
34:07
same as your commercial discussion, you have now set an anchor that okay, it's a 120k per per year kind of deal if the PC
34:16
works. So you have to be clear that the 10K is only for building a business case. Commercial discussions will follow
34:23
after that. It is not an indication of the actual commercial discussion. But your you know buyer on the other side
34:30
might still push you saying that's all great but I I need a price or a budget otherwise I won't move forward with it.
34:35
So there are two ways to actually you know deflect those kind of questions. The first way is you know contextualize
34:42
the price on the value. So you you can say something like if if you're push for price, hey for customers such as yours,
34:49
you know, we have been able to at least unlock 10 million in very similar situations and our pricing is, you know,
34:55
1 is to 10x when it comes to ROI. So you basically said that you're a million dollars to actually get started, but you
35:02
actually didn't say it. You just said it's a 10 million and I'm I'm taking one in 10 in in exchange for it. So you've
35:07
kind of given the buyer an indication, but you have framed it in such a manner that that actually is justifiable,
35:12
right? one in 10x ROI. So that's one way to do it. They might still say yeah that's good but I need a you know
35:19
budget. So then rather than just give them a budget saying it could be a 200k you know uh option. Don't do that.
35:25
That's the worst thing you can actually say. Give them a range. You can say something like look the final pricing would be anywhere from 500k to a
35:32
million. And based on the business case that we would co-create with you we can pick a point in in that range that
35:39
justifies the value that we bring to the table. So you're giving budgetary ranges, right? So that's the other way
35:44
to actually go about PC's. So how you navigate your early wins, who you choose
35:50
uh is very critical when you're building companies at scale and fast in AI because that actually dictates the
35:56
destiny for the you know rest of your future and picking those early wins is very very critical and uh and having you
36:04
know buyers who are serious lead qualifying having the right PC process and thinking about PC's as frankly not
36:12
just uh trying to see if your product actually works and delivers value But it's a great chance to have a commercial
36:17
test and learn experiment and have fun with it and try to see what you can you know bring to the table in terms of your
36:23
value and what portion can you actually take. So the core kind of takeaway here is for AI companies you no longer can
The importance of mastering monetization
36:31
just grow and figure out monetization later. Your advice here is uh what you start with is what you're going to end
36:36
up with. And it's very easy to undermonetize because people aren't
36:41
realizing that they're now helping with actual labor force uh savings versus
36:47
just like SAS software that's making people a little bit more efficient. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I strongly
36:52
believe that the winners in AI will need to master monetization and they need to ma master it from day one. I mean and
36:59
when we talk to early stage founders it is a topic that keeps many people up at night but that's also why we wrote
37:05
scaling innovation and other assets so that they can get some more courage to think about you know pricing correctly
37:11
from day one and it's uh become very critical for AI companies to do that. Do you feel like the popular IDE
37:18
startups I won't name names do you think they've undermonetized and they're going to be in trouble down the road?
37:24
Some of them for sure have. I think they will probably run out of it because they might show a lot of uh let's say uh fast
37:31
revenue growth but is that enduring revenue are people actually going to stay and is there going to be churn and
37:37
you know so there are a lot of uh uh aspects to architecting profitable growth it's not just growing fast but
37:42
also growing profitably and having an enduring business so some of them yes without naming names uh but uh yeah I
37:50
think that's why it's it's it's important to be thoughtful about market share and wallet share well those are So
37:55
there I think what you're saying here is they may not the retention may not work for some of these companies but on the
38:01
other hand they're really cheap like 20 bucks a month to help your engineer be like 10 times more productive
38:06
potentially like is that too good a deal? Do you think they should have priced a lot higher? Yeah, for sure. I
38:12
mean if you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to expect $20 a month and
38:17
you anchored yourself on a low price point. I think there are companies that have actually done that and they try to
38:22
undo it with like you know having more sophisticated let's say products that are actually higher priced or much
38:29
higher priced etc. That's one way to like undo that situation. So it is it's really a trade-off between you know
38:35
getting more customers and making money at the same time. That's the whole point of the book market share and wallet
38:40
share and how do you dominate both? So, if they're being thoughtful about both and have a vision to not just, you know,
38:46
grow market share, but also have a clear strategy to land and expand and increase wallet share, those strategies might pan
38:52
out for those types of companies. If you just threw out a $20 product hoping to just, you know, accelerate your market
38:57
share, you're in trouble. Okay, this is a great segue to this 2x two, which goes much deeper into this. So, it's easy to
Choosing the right AI pricing model
39:03
be like, here's what you shouldn't do. Here's your advice on what to actually do. So, I'm going to pull up on my screen this 2 by two that you have in
39:10
your book. So if you're watching on YouTube, you'll be able to see it. Uh so talk about this. This is essentially how
39:15
to figure out an I the best possible pricing model and where you have the most power. So when you talk about AI
39:21
companies and you know monetization models, we get asked this question. Should I be usage based? Should I be
39:26
outcome? Should I be you know a copilot mode or how do I actually think about my
39:31
pricing model? So we came up with this framework which is a you know relatively simple straightforward framework but
39:38
very powerful. So there are two axes here. One is attribution and the other one is autonomy. And when you have high
39:45
attribution and high autonomy, that is when you have high pricing power. And we'll come back to that in a bit. Right?
39:51
So let's take the first uh you know bottom left quadrant. That is the quadrant where your attribution is low
39:57
and your autonomy is low. In that situation, the best pricing archetype that actually fits is it is actually a
40:04
seedbased or a subscription model because there's not much to do about it because you're not, you know, being able
40:10
to like attribute a lot of value to what you bring, but you're in a co-pilot mode and you're not in an autonomous mode.
40:15
So, a seatbased pricing would actually make sense. But if you're at that quadrant, the immediate thing to think
40:20
about is how do you actually build more attribution and move to the right so that you actually get more pricing
40:26
power. Uh so if you think about the you know bottom right quadrant those are
40:32
companies that have actually done that they have more they can prove more attribution to like what they actually
40:37
bring to the table but they are still not in a fully autonomous mode as in there is still humans in the loop. If
40:43
you take cursor for instance you know it definitely improves productivity can actually bring down the time to actually
40:49
you know do code the attribution is clear but it's still in a co-pilot mode. In those kind of situations, a hybrid
40:55
pricing model is the best option where you still have a, you know, seedbased model for the co-pilot kind of use case,
41:02
but you also layer in a consumption model which actually says there are certain number of AI credits or tokens
41:08
that can layer in the usage aspects. So if you use more and more then you're actually paying more on consumption. So
41:14
it's a hybrid model that actually works there. If you look at the top uh you
41:20
know left quadrant those are you know products that are very autonomous but are not uh strong on attribution. So
41:28
these tend to be mostly like backend or infrastructure kind of products that are core critical to like run businesses can
41:35
be autonomous uh but they are not directly impacting the KPIs that
41:41
businesses are tracking and hence cannot prove attribution very effectively. So
41:47
you know in that situation you need to be on a pay for what you consume and a usage based model a seatbased model
41:53
would not make sense because autonomous there's no human in the loop. Uh but that's why you're also in a usage based
41:59
model saying the more you use it uh the more you're actually charged and usage becomes a proxy for the value that you
42:05
bring to the table. The quadrant that you really want to be in is the golden uh you know quadrant which is the top
42:12
right one. That's the outcome based pricing model where you have great autonomy and great attribution. And here
42:19
is where I think AI can be really magical. So this means you're not only charging for work delivered but you're
42:26
charging for work delivered that was delivered by AI without no humans in the loop. So that becomes more of an outcome
42:33
based model situation. So a classic example here is you know intercom for Finn. Uh what they actually do is they
42:40
charge based on an AI resolution. So if an AI is able to you know resolve the
42:45
ticket completely independently without a human in the loop then they charge for it. If a human intervention is needed
42:51
they don't charge for it. So they are more on an outcome based model or like companies like you know charge flow
42:57
would charge you know up to 25% on a charge back that they are able to actually recover because these are like
43:03
you know core savings that you actually bring to the table based on your AI. It is highly attributable highly
43:09
autonomous. So you can start moving towards an outcomebased pricing model. If you look at the state of where AI is
Current trends in AI pricing
43:16
today as of the day of recording this podcast, uh now the most popular model
43:22
is right now a hybrid pricing model. So because this is also expected because
43:27
you know the previous SAS playbook was usually on the seatbased model but they've all now moved on to at least a
43:34
hybrid to actually incorporate AI credits and usage etc. uh about 5% of
43:39
companies are probably in a true outcomebased pricing model uh you know as of as of today but those companies
43:47
some of the best ones are able to recover 25 to 50% of the value that they
43:53
actually bring to the table in the classic SAS situation we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value
43:58
that's actually great but in AI you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is
44:04
autonomous you're doing it with the AI there's no humans in the loop. You know, you're creating incremental value to
44:10
like the business metrics. You're producing hard cost savings as opportunity costs. You can justify all
44:16
of that. It's attributable. So, you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table in there lot of
44:23
benchmarks and studies that actually show that and this is also my belief
44:28
that in the next 3 years that 5% number will move to 25%. So what this really
44:34
means is if you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant
44:39
because that's the magic quadrant. If you can truly, you know, price based on
44:44
outcomes, you've achieved and unlock tremendous value. Wow. Okay, I'm just
Strategizing for outcome-based models
44:50
going to pause again. This is amazing, Maravan. Thank you so much for I love that again that you just spent years, decades studying this stuff. Come here,
44:57
tell us all the answers of what we should be doing. This is incredible. Let me ask you this. Uh, by the way, for FEP
45:03
folks not watching on YouTube, the companies you have in the golden quadrant, outcome based pricing, Sierra,
45:09
Finn, and ChargeFlow, we've got the founder of Sierra and Finn coming on the podcast soon, so we'll talk about all
45:14
this with those guys. Awesome. So, so is the way to use this 2 by two
45:21
figuring out your model like is it like, okay, I'm like cursor, I'm going to go
45:27
in this quadrant, or is it how do I get to outcome base no matter what? that's where I need to be.
45:32
Yeah. So that's a great question. The first one is to actually figure out uh you know what is your right archetype
45:39
based on where you are today. I think that is most important like if you try to rush into an outcome based pricing
45:44
model but cannot prove attribution you will fail right. So it is really coming up with uh what is the right architect
45:50
based on what I'm doing today but also use this 2x two to say how do I you know paint a vision to actually get to
45:57
outcome based and can I get how can I get close to that or can I be purely an outcome based model right how do I
46:03
evolve into that what that would mean is you know how do I build functionality in
46:09
the products to actually show attribution how do I build more agentic workforces to like take the human out of
46:14
the loop and be more autonomous and being thoughtful about your vision and strategy so that you will orient
46:19
yourself towards more you know outcome based pricing models. So when you think about increasing attribution that means
46:26
first of all understanding you know what are the KPIs of your uh customers how do
46:32
they track their business performance can you impact it can you productize things in your product that showcase
46:37
that you are actually affecting those KPIs in a positive manner can you build dashboards to show you know value
46:43
attribution uh can you do those value audits that we talked about on an ongoing basis to actually show that
46:49
you're bringing a lot of value to the table and is attributable to too. So how do you create these kind of attribution
46:55
mechanisms become important and also autonomous based on like you know building more agentic workforces that
47:01
can actually be on an autonomous mode. So pick the right archetype and plan to
47:06
like get to like as close as you can to the outcome based pricing model. That's how I would use the 2x two. And you
47:13
actually kind of see this happening with certain industries, right? If you think about coding as a overall category like
47:20
uh you know back in the day with GitHub everyone they started with a seatbased model right they've now moved to like
47:25
the hybrid based pricing model with cursors and everyone else but the natural move would be more towards a
47:30
outcome based pricing model where you know a AI agent can probably code everything uh at the same time debug it
47:37
and you're kind of almost hiring a AI developer or AI QA person and that
47:43
actually becomes more closer to like a outcomebased model because it's attributable and autonomous. So there is
47:49
picking the right archetype and then figuring out your pathway is is the key way to interpret this 2x two. This
47:56
explains why everyone's bullying agents. That's where the money's at is what you're telling us here. Yeah. Okay. And
48:01
it's going to be the age of the matrix. Too many agents agent smiths everywhere. That didn't turn out too great. Um so
48:09
what I'm hearing is if I were Canva, so Canva here in your model is bottom right. They're in a hybrid pricing
48:14
model. They have a base fee and consumption fee. What I what you would do if you were helping Canva is what can
48:20
you build that creates more autonomy, an autonomous version of Canva? And it's
48:25
not like you need to do this. It's just you have more pricing power if you figure something out there.
48:31
Exactly. I mean and uh and a good case for that is the you know fin product
48:36
from intercom because traditionally you know all of those kind of companies used to price based on an agent basis. how
48:42
many customer service agents are actually using the product. It used to be seedbased but they built out FIN
48:47
which is a completely AI resolution for those kind of support tickets and then that actually enables them to like move
48:53
to the outcome based pricing model quadrant. Amazing. So you say you're an AI founder today. You're thinking about
48:59
your pricing strategy, your monetization strategy long term. Your advice is work with design partners, create these PC's
49:07
where you work on this ROI model with them to ideally find some outcomebased
49:14
pricing strategy. Is that a good way to summarize? What would you add to that? Yes. I mean, um, at least be able to
49:20
contextualize the business case. Even if you're not moving to an outcomebased pricing model, be clear on the outcome
49:27
that you're actually, you know, creating for your customers through that business case, which actually will enable you to
49:33
charge a fair price in exchange for that outcome. And if you're, you know, if your customers agree with the business
49:39
case, then you can actually take a portion of that. Finn actually, they're a new sponsor of
49:44
the podcast and I learned I didn't know this. It cost 99 cents for every out for every support ticket they sold
49:51
through AI. If it's a exactly if it needs a human intervention then they don't charge for it.
49:56
Yeah. And it's just like what that's such a simple story. Your agent cost 20 bucks. This things cost 99 cents.
50:04
Yeah. That is uh two chapters in one. Beautifully simple pricing and an outcome based pricing model.
50:09
And interestingly they were the the least like the most hated pricing model initially. I did a survey on Twitter
50:15
once like what products you pay the most for and it was always intercom and everyone hated their pricing and they
50:20
found a solution. I think they have found a great solution. Okay. So, is there anything else along
Packaging strategies for scaling
50:25
these lines that you think companies especially AI companies should be thinking when they're thinking about pricing that you want to share before we
50:33
move on to other stuff? I think we've covered most of the topics like we said it's uh you know being thoughtful about
50:39
PC's choosing the right you know pricing archetype or the pricing models those things become very critical in the early
50:46
stages but when you start scaling and let's say you become a multi-product company then you need to start focusing
50:52
on what what kind of packaging strategy should I have is it a platform plus
50:57
add-ons should I have like versions of the products like good better best should I tackle different use cases
51:03
because now my AI can solve an insurance use case and a you know healthcare use case should I productize to like
51:10
different use cases is that my packaging strategy or should I keep it completely modularized for like people to pick and
51:16
choose so these kind of questions become more critical and that's why the chapter on uh blowing up your packaging from
51:23
your early days and coming up with your packaging strategy for your scaleup phase become very critical so I think
51:28
that's the next thing that founders would be hit with as and when they build multiple products they need to think
51:34
about the whole packaging, cross-selling, upselling motion. This touches on something I was about to
Adapting pricing strategies over time
51:39
ask, which is a change in your pricing strategy. Uh, how often does is does it
51:45
is it a success to change the way you price? Like I know we're talking about you need to get it right from the
51:50
beginning if you're an AI company. In your experience, how often like what does it take to successfully shift the
51:55
way you price down the road? If people are listening to this and like we already have this pricing strategy. Back in the day, we used to say that you
52:02
should revisit your pricing strategy, overall pricing model, you know, how much you're charging at least once in
52:08
two years. With AI, that's probably reduced in half. Um, because of the scale with which and the speed with
52:13
which companies are built and competing. So, I would say that it is an ongoing journey. It is not like you just solve
52:20
it in day one, you know, fill it and forget it. It has to be uh you know you
52:25
have to be thoughtful from day one but also be ready to like pivot iterate and you're going to learn along your
52:31
journey. So the whole point is to think about pricing as also a test and learn
52:36
opportunity in your early days and there are things that you would change more often and there are things that you
52:42
probably don't want to change too often like things like pricing model. Unless you have, you know, really changed your
52:48
attribution autonomy, there is no need to like shift your pricing model. Stay within that archetype. Don't confuse
52:53
things. But there are things like price points. Should I increase my price because it's been, you know, 6 months or
52:59
a year? Yeah, you should because in a year there's probably prices go up 3 to 5% for everything that you consume. But
53:06
how can you actually increase your prices and be thoughtful about it? So that entire chapter on how to do price
53:11
increases you know smartly become very important in the you know scaleup phase. I think Warren Buffett summarized this
53:18
really well. He said uh the true definition of a company is a pricing power and if you have a prayer session
53:24
for doing a 10% price increase you have a terrible business. So you have to be able to increase prices over a bit of
53:30
time. But how do you do it strategically that does not affect too much churn but you're also able to like pass on the
53:36
increase as a value exchange. those things become critical. Awesome. Zooming out a little bit, something that I love
Key axioms for pricing success
53:43
about your book is you structured it around these axioms. You have a bunch of these really clever axioms that get
53:48
stuck in your head and help you think about pricing. Can you share some of your favorites, maybe two or three of your favorite axioms from the book? U
53:55
you talked about uh Sierra being in your part founders. I don't know if that's Clay, but he has a shout out for like
54:01
Clay. So Clay actually u read the entire book and gave me feedback scaling
54:06
innovation the similar copy that you actually had and I had uh I called it
54:12
scaling innovation axioms throughout the book and the whole point of the axioms was that at the end of the day if you
54:18
can just take all the axioms put it in a you know print out next to your desk it's the summary of the book and it's
54:23
like PT statements that you will just remember what to do. So he came up with this idea that hey rather than calling
54:29
them just generic scaling innovation axioms you need to brand each and every axiom and I thought that was a brilliant
54:35
idea. So I went about coming up with a unique he he even contributed some of the names. So we came about you know we
54:42
we came up with some unique names for each axiom. And here's the other fun fact uh probably I'm geeking out too
54:48
much but when I counted the number of axioms there were 42 axioms. Uh so and I
54:53
didn't try to make this up and if you're Hitchhiker's fan then you know that's the answer to everything. Uh but jokes
54:58
apart uh let me unpack a few axioms. The first uh one of my first favorite axioms
55:04
what what I call as the 2080 axiom. So in in especially in tech companies you
55:09
know 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is
55:16
that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often. So what founders do is they
55:21
put this take this 20% build it put it out in the market almost for free and
55:27
then they're chasing their tails to build 80% stuff that's only driving 20% willingness to pay. So if you have not
55:32
been thoughtful about that you've given the farm away unintentionally. So truly understanding what drives willingness to
55:40
pay in your product is critical. And I think you know people call it the MVP. I
55:45
think we should change the definition of MVP. It shouldn't be minimum viable product. It should be the most valuable
55:50
product and be thoughtful about what are you actually giving out as your early
55:56
products I think is key. That's the 2080 axiom. Probably my second one is the you know uh price paralysis axioms. So um
56:04
you know what that means is your reluctance to do a price increase is often internal and emotional and it's
56:12
not external and logical. This goes back to the same uh you know prayer session
56:17
to actually do a price increase. If you're holding hands, you have a terrible business, right? I mean, so
56:22
like it's mostly internal and emotional and how do you how do you be thoughtful about price increases become important.
56:28
My probably my uh uh you know, third favorite one is stopping churn before it
56:34
happens is stopping churn axiom. Um so to stop churn, you need to attract customers who won't leave. That sounds
56:41
counterintuitive, but that's the best way to actually stop churn. What does this actually mean? You know most
56:46
companies would try to stop churn when someone actually says I want to go. It is too late and you're being reactive.
56:53
At the most you'll throw some offers. They will stay for another 6 months and they will leave. They've already made that determination. The way to stop
57:00
churn is to start up start acquiring customers who won't leave and that is
57:05
the most important thing. So if you look back at your you know data and say who are the types of customers who actually
57:11
tend to stay longer, what are their characteristics? How can I focus my acquisition dollars in getting more of
57:17
those than your stop churn before it happens? And that's the key. That's interesting. I'm surprised you
57:24
didn't say what was my favorite, which is I think it's like if you land, make sure to expand. Yeah,
57:29
that one really stuck with me. Maybe talk about that one. Yeah, sure. I mean, so if you if you land, you
57:34
need to also make sure you're you're expanding in the sense that, you know, if you give the farm away in your entry-
57:39
level product, you don't have much to actually, you know, monetize later. So being thoughtful about you know what is
57:45
the fence between your land product uh you know what is it a free experience
57:51
what what is the gating and the gating is typically based on you know are you gating based on features are you also
57:56
getting based on usage and how do you be thoughtful about that so you leave stuff for the expansion. Okay. So, zooming out
Takeaways for founders
58:03
even further to kind of wrap up, what would you say is the biggest lesson you
58:09
want founders to take away that they're probably they think they understand but they probably don't. Yeah, I think this
58:14
comes back to what you started with. I think intuitively people get it that they need to think about market share
58:21
and wallet share if they're going and even if you ask them they say like yeah yeah I'm thinking about wallet share but
58:26
have they really thought about it uh equally and paid equal attention? Have
58:31
they you know postponed one of them? Are they operating in a single engine strategy consciously or subconsciously?
58:38
I think that's the key takeaway I have. So the contrarian take is not to put equal effort on both the you know
58:46
engines at the same time. In certain stages of your company you might need to be more market share dominating. In
58:52
certain stages you might need to be wallet share dominating. It's not equal effort but it's equal attention. and
58:58
like really developing that mindset of being a true profitable growth architect
59:03
and that is the main takeaway that I have for people and if you are not in
59:09
that mindset already there's a book for you I'll point them to it so just so folks know what to do when they're like
59:15
okay I need to focus on wallet share more is the main focus figure out a
59:20
pricing model that aligns well with pricing power what's like what's in the bucket of work to do to invest more in
59:27
wallet wallet share thinking. So it it's actually all of those uh you know uh market share, wallet share,
59:33
acquisition, monetization, retention are all kind of like correlated. You can't think about them in isolation. So I
59:39
wouldn't say only for wallet share what do you need to do if you want to grow on both the market share and wallet share.
59:46
Let's say for instance you know you need to have the right land and expand strategy. The land helps you with uh
59:51
acquisition. The expansion helps you with wallet share. Um if you have a you know pricing model then you need to have
59:58
a pricing model that lets you acquire faster because it's intuitive but it should also help you recover value which
1:00:04
is like your monetization and if people understand your pricing model they're actually going to stay. So it's all sort
1:00:10
of you know goes hand in hand. Um so I wouldn't isolate thinking one way or the
1:00:16
other. That's why the nine strategies actually are very powerful because if you follow those strategies, you're not
1:00:22
going to fall into the single engine trap. These are tried and tested strategies of how to build businesses in
1:00:28
such a way that you're being thoughtful and paying equal attention to both market share and wallet share.
1:00:34
All right, that is a very reasonable answer. Manabon, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting
1:00:40
lightning round? read the two books in sequence, monetizing innovation and scaling innovation because it's one
1:00:46
thing to build a great product. It's yet another thing to build a great business. You cannot build a great business with a
1:00:52
not so great product and you cannot do it the other way around either. So I think it's uh having thinking about
1:00:59
pricing early uh especially for AI companies being thoughtful about it know
1:01:04
like like you know price before product and then thinking about how to actually scale developing a profitable growth
1:01:11
mindset all of these things become critical and I'm looking forward to the feedback from the audience.
1:01:16
I feel like your books are kind of like in the the staple of founder reading. there's like all these things you just
1:01:22
don't know what you're doing and there's a few of these books that are like okay here's all this advice that'll answer so
1:01:27
many questions and save you so much heartache and so uh I'm really excited you you're adding something to that
1:01:32
bookshelf with that we reached our very exciting lightning round argument okay let's go
Lightning round and final thoughts
1:01:37
let's go two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people the first one that comes to mind
1:01:43
is Business Model Canvas by Alex Ostraaler is a classic and one of my favorite books I recommend a lot of
1:01:50
people to read that because I think it nicely ties a lot of what we are also saying from a more strategic business
1:01:56
model angle. I like this book uh thinking fast thinking slow. I think that's also a classic because again uh
1:02:02
you know there's always a human element to things and understanding the customer psychology is important whether you're
1:02:08
in B2C or in B2B because if you're in a B2B situation is humans having a human conversation. So like it's as much
1:02:14
behavioral as it's actually numbers. So I I love that book and there's a lot of nuggets in there. So I recommend it a
1:02:19
lot. And probably the third one that I recommend is a book uh called Contagious
1:02:25
by Jonah Burgerer. Uh I love that. he was in the PhD program at Stanford um in
1:02:30
marketing and he actually wrote this book on how to make messages viral and he's actually seen you know the best
1:02:38
viral messages and boil it down to a framework and if you follow that um then you can make those messages viral and
1:02:44
I've tried to use some of those in uh you know my own outreaches and things of that nature. So I think it's a it's a
1:02:50
fantastic read. Wow. Check this out and I have not. I haven't even heard of it. All right. Well, we're gonna go viral there. So, we
1:02:56
got the playbook. Contagious. That's the name of the book. Contagious. Okay, we'll link to that. Is
1:03:01
there uh a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed? I guess uh movie. Sure. Let's pick a
1:03:06
movie. Um definitely enjoyed uh Mission Impossible uh the final one. Eighth in
1:03:12
the sequence. I I think I find that a whole uh I love those the entire genre 1
1:03:19
through eight. Uh but what I kind of like about it is my willingness to pay has constantly increased over a period
1:03:26
of time. They could have charged me whatever they wanted for the eighth movie. I would have probably gone and seen it because I wanted to. So I
1:03:31
thought that's a interesting example of like a durable brand where your you know your monetization power actually
1:03:37
increase over a period of time. So I think um I enjoyed the movie u it was great. Um yeah I mean hey by the way I
1:03:44
just realized MI stands for monetizing innovation and also Mission Impossible.
1:03:49
Maybe subconsciously that's why I liked it too. And you're the Tom Cruz character. You must That's So I love how you're the
1:03:56
only person in the world that thinks of Mission Impossible through monetization, willingness to pay. Exactly. I think there's too many of
1:04:03
these dinner conversations also gravitate towards pricing and and monetization. I think it's become my
1:04:08
life. So Oh man, we need a we need a version of this movie like a Mission Impossible of Monavon.
1:04:14
Sure. I pay I pay anything for that. All right, next question. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered
1:04:20
that you really love? Um, I would probably talk about two products. The first one is uh Deli uh
1:04:27
the you know digital mind representation. That's a Lenny bot that you actually uh I think put out. So I
1:04:32
think I find that product fascinating and I also love the founders D and Sam
1:04:37
there. I I truly believe that that is going to be the future for like you know thought leadership and how thoughts are
1:04:44
consumed by like consumers. Like if I can and I've used your Lenny bot. I really enjoy it. Like if I can, you
1:04:50
know, co-create some thought leadership piece with talking to you, but it's not you, your AI, and it's actually living
1:04:55
and breathing your brain. How cool is that? And I think that I I really love the product category. There's a lot of,
1:05:01
you know, different use cases, longit longevity extension use cases, things of
1:05:06
that nature. I'm excited about uh about the product. I think it's it's been great. I I plan to taking inspiration
1:05:12
from you plan to create a deli of myself. I think it should be out before the uh book maybe I'll try to that's the
1:05:20
promise try to keep it ready. So I think if you want to talk more about uh the book or things of that nature and talk
1:05:27
pricing, you can talk to my AI too, right? I mean I I find the product fascinating. The second one I would probably say that's been super uh useful
1:05:35
in terms of just productivity is granola. We we love that product. I think just the ability to take notes and
1:05:41
during all the meetings and you know organize it and being able to query things etc. I think it's been a great
1:05:46
product uh that we recently started trying and uh we've been really liking it. Cool. That's been the most mentioned
1:05:52
product recently. How cool is that? Love granola. Get a year free of granola if you're a paid subscriber to my
1:05:58
newsletter. Lenny'snewsletter.com. Click bundle. One year free. Not just you, your whole team. What an offer they
1:06:03
offer. It's crazy. Uh on Deli. What's interesting about Lennybot is it's not
1:06:08
just my knowledge, it's every single podcast guest's insights and lessons
1:06:14
also fed into it. So, it's uh what an oracle of knowledge this thing's become. And it's free at this point. completely
1:06:20
free. Lennybot.com. No, I I get nothing from it. It's just out there. Okay, next question. Uh, do you have a favorite
1:06:28
life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life? You know, create value in everything and
1:06:35
anything that you touch, everything else will follow. That's my life motto.
1:06:40
That resonates deeply. Okay, last question. You recently moved into investing. So what's cool is you used to
1:06:47
be very expensive to work with at Simon Kutcher I think it was called very expensive a lot of big company stuff now
1:06:54
a lot more founders have access to you because you're investing in startups so just talk about that talk about what you're doing these days sure I mean at
1:07:01
at Simon Kutcher you know I got to uh work with over 250 companies and my
1:07:06
co-GP now Josh Bloom uh he also had an opportunity to work with about 250 companies so combined we work with over
1:07:12
500 companies more than you know 50 plus unic Cons. It was a great ride. Um, and
1:07:17
often we were actually working with them in much later stages, you know, when series D or preipo, post IPO, private
1:07:24
equity companies, etc. Um, but the two of us actually now started a venture
1:07:30
firm with an explicit goal of working with early stage AI founders. And it
1:07:36
goes back to the topic that we started with, you know, AI companies needs to deal with monetization from day one. But
1:07:42
for those kind of companies, you know, FIFA service transaction model doesn't necessarily work. Um, and that's also
1:07:49
why we pivoted to like venture. So our business model is pretty uh, you know, pretty standard right now. If you get
1:07:55
access in the cap table, we roll up our sleeves and work with the founders and all monetization. So we invested in their success and we will partake in the
1:08:02
value creation. Um, there's no fee for service, no friction on those kind of manners. But on the flip side, we get to
1:08:09
concentrate our efforts uh uh in fund one and probably 20 to 25 companies and
1:08:14
that's where we will be spending our time. What a deal. Manavon, two final questions. Where can folks find you if
1:08:20
they want to reach out and talk about this offer? And how can listeners be useful to you? Ways to find out. I think uh just uh
1:08:28
Google for monetizing innovation and scaling innovation. You'll probably land in a lot of pages. You can also go to Amazon. I think if you want to purchase
1:08:34
the book actually uh scaling innovation is now available in pre-order. Um I think we'll have the pot part released
1:08:41
uh before the book is actually out. The book is going to be out on August 5th. So there's an opportunity to pre-order
1:08:47
and maybe I will uh take an inspiration from your master bundle which I really think is the world's best bundle uh and
1:08:54
come up with my own bundle for like getting users to like pre-order. So if you love monetizing innovation I can
1:09:00
tell you you would really love scaling innovation. So, go buy it for your teams, uh, buy it for yourself, and, uh,
1:09:06
here's the offer. So, for anyone who's able to like buy more than five copies,
1:09:13
send us a, uh, you know, screenshot of your purchase, pre-order, right? Send us
1:09:18
a screenshot of your purchase to promo at 49psvc.com.
1:09:24
So, that's promo as in promotion at 49pmvc.com.
1:09:30
And here's the bundle offer that I have. 10 people will get access to uh you know
1:09:36
bundles as a raffle. And the bundle is going to include a signed copy of Scaling Innovation, uh a 30 minute ask
1:09:43
me anything session, an exclusive invite for a scaling innovation book launch and
1:09:49
also a scaling innovation t-shirt. So that's my uh coming up with a bundle. I didn't get granola and others to put in
1:09:56
for me just yet. But I think this hopefully suffices and is exciting for folks uh to buy. Um and yeah, I mean uh
1:10:03
if you like the book uh please do leave a review on Amazon. That always is helpful because if more people review
1:10:09
it, um the book takes a life of its own. And I'm really thankful for also the
1:10:15
support that I got over the years from founder community, from the venture community, for monetizing innovation.
1:10:20
And I think there's been, you know, over the last uh 8 years, thousands and thousands of fans of the books. They've
1:10:27
done a whole lot talking about it, writing reviews, uh, you know, posting
1:10:32
uh, on LinkedIn and, uh, you know, making things like price before product or, you know, price product market price
1:10:39
fit and things as a part of founder vocabulary. So, I'm very passionate that
1:10:44
people actually did that and very thankful for them. Uh so there's also probably uh in equal measure if you're
1:10:50
excited about scaling innovation uh I would love for you to talk about the book. Amazing. And I think the reason people
1:10:57
do that is because you give away so much for free. Like you know you you just shared so much wisdom for free that is
1:11:03
going to help so many people. So yeah I just tried to plan my give and get right there.
1:11:09
Oh my god. A good call back. Uh Maravan, this is incredible. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much Lenny. It was a
1:11:15
pleasure. Same. Bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening. If you

pricing is one of the riskiest aspects
0:01
of any business model but most Founders
0:04
choose to defer pricing to later they
0:06
wait to First build their product
0:08
understand their cost structure and then
0:09
set pricing with customers this is
0:12
backwards your pricing model should
0:14
determine your product and not the other
0:16
way around and the best time to set your
0:18
pricing model is a lot sooner than you
0:20
think so in this video I'm going to show
0:22
you how hi there if you're new to this
0:24
channel my name is Ash Moria I'm an
0:26
entrepreneur and author and the creator
0:28
of the onepage business modeling tool
0:30
lean canvas on this channel I share
0:32
systematic strategies and techniques for
0:34
starting and growing a business a
0:36
popular strategy when launching a new
0:38
product is to give it away for free so
0:40
that you can learn from users get them
0:42
to try before they buy then set pricing
0:45
based on what users would be willing to
0:47
pay while sound in theory things seldom
0:49
work this way in practice because one
0:52
users are different from customers while
0:55
all customers start out as users not all
0:57
users go on to become customers when you
1:00
give away your product for free you will
1:02
attract more users than customers who
1:04
tend to drown out the true voice of your
1:07
customer it becomes harder to filter
1:09
customer feedback that you should follow
1:12
and instead you end up following the
1:13
vocal majority which steers you down the
1:16
wrong path next your pricing model is
1:19
very much part of your product and it
1:20
determines which kind of customers you
1:23
attract suppose I place two bottles of
1:25
water in front of you and tell you that
1:27
the one on the right costs 50 cents and
1:29
the the other cost $2 even though you
1:32
couldn't tell them apart in a blind
1:34
taste test because they are similar
1:36
enough you might be inclined to believe
1:38
or at least wonder if the more expensive
1:40
water is of higher quality here price
1:43
has the power to change your perception
1:45
of the product now more interestingly
1:47
the bottled water you pick also
1:49
determines which customer segment you
1:51
belong in from the existing market for
1:53
bottled water we know that there is a
1:55
viable business model for bottled water
1:57
at both price points so what you charge
2:00
signals your positioning on which
2:02
customers you want to attract and
2:04
finally it is not the user's job to set
2:07
pricing that's your job because your
2:09
business model and product survival
2:12
depend on it can you imagine Steve Jobs
2:14
asking customers what they'd be willing
2:16
to pay for an iPhone or iPad in the next
2:19
section I'll cover how to set pricing by
2:22
first starting with what not to do first
2:25
you should completely forget cost based
2:27
pricing which is something a lot of
2:29
people do by first determining their
2:30
cost structure and then slapping a
2:33
margin to set their price this too is
2:35
backwards because customers don't care
2:37
about your solution or cost structure
2:40
but rather their problems and outcomes
2:43
when buying that iPhone do you justify
2:45
pricing by slapping a fair margin on
2:47
Apple's unit costs no of course you
2:49
don't you justify pricing based on your
2:52
perceived value of what the iPhone will
2:54
let you do compared to other smartphones
2:57
and more importantly how it makes you
2:59
feel value based pricing is another way
3:01
of setting pricing and while it's
3:03
certainly better than cost based pricing
3:05
it's still not enough in value based
3:08
pricing you anchor your pricing against
3:10
your product's unique value proposition
3:13
and the cost of similar Alternatives
3:15
your product's fair price sits somewhere
3:17
between these two anchors now this two
3:20
isn't enough because it's possible to
3:22
set a fair price for your product but
3:24
still fail to build a viable business
3:26
model and then you get stuck this is why
3:29
I recomend Rec commend setting business
3:30
modelbased pricing before value based
3:33
pricing setting business modelbased
3:35
pricing is a three-step process Step One
3:38
is where you outline all the ways that
3:41
you could achieve your business model
3:43
goal or minimum success criteria you
3:45
want to avoid starting with your product
3:47
or idea and instead determining that
3:50
business model outcome based on your
3:52
minimum success criteria that you would
3:54
use to deem any project a success in 3
3:58
years for more on how to thing through
4:00
your business model criteria I've linked
4:02
another video here in the top right
4:04
corner now once you determine your
4:06
minimum success criteria the next step
4:09
is to outline all the ways that you
4:11
could achieve this outcome for example
4:13
if my goal is to build a $1 million a
4:16
year business there are really only five
4:18
ways to accomplish this notice that this
4:20
approach is idea agnostic rather it's
4:23
goal oriented when you start thinking
4:25
this way you quickly realize that there
4:27
are only a finite number of ways to
4:29
build any size of business in the Second
4:31
Step you begin to model specific
4:34
business model variants that could meet
4:36
that minimum success criteria goal of
4:38
yours I'll illustrate this with a
4:40
personal example in 2010 I introduced
4:43
the onepage business modeling template
4:44
lean canvas and a blog post today the
4:47
lean canvas is used by millions of
4:49
people around the world but going back
4:51
in time here are some of the ways I
4:53
considered building a $1 million
4:56
business around the lean canas some of
4:59
these ideas are more feasible than
5:00
others While others are more fitting to
5:03
the kind of company I wanted to build
5:05
finding fit here is what I call founder
5:07
model fit and it's best to find this fit
5:10
before pursuing product Market fit
5:12
here's how I prioritized my list of
5:15
options for myself selling 100,000
5:17
ebooks a year may sound easy to some of
5:20
you but most products like books convert
5:23
at a very low percentage 1% head scale
5:26
this would require building a huge top
5:28
of the funnel with 10 million people
5:31
while not impossible it's certainly not
5:33
easy my goal with my business was to
5:35
prioritize impact and purpose over
5:38
profit while I could potentially charge
5:40
High Consulting fees and build a large
5:42
consulting company I didn't want to
5:44
limit my expertise to just tens or
5:46
hundreds of clients a year these high-
5:48
price options didn't fit my personal
5:51
founder Mission and my last constraint
5:53
came from being a technical founder I
5:55
wanted to leverage software in some way
5:58
versus just using people and time to
6:00
build out the business this is how I
6:02
ended up building an online lead canvas
6:04
tool that grew into leanstack the final
6:07
step is to short list your most
6:09
promising variants by picking a big
6:11
enough market that you want to serve now
6:14
when you go through an exercise like
6:16
this it's perfectly okay and even
6:18
advisable to end up with a top one to
6:20
three variant business models it's a
6:23
good idea to test these in parallel for
6:25
a little while to find your one variant
6:27
your primary business model when you do
6:30
you want to stay razor focused on that
6:32
and drive it to product Market fit
6:34
picking just one variant to focus on is
6:36
probably the step that most Founders
6:38
struggle with myself included because
6:40
it's so tempting to say yes to anyone
6:43
who might want to pay you but having
6:45
five ways of making money at five
6:47
different price points across different
6:49
customer segments when your pre-product
6:51
Market fit is a recipe for spreading
6:53
your limited resources to thin embracing
6:56
a singular product singular price point
6:59
and singular Beach head customer focus
7:01
is vital until you hit product market so
7:05
when do you apply business modelbased
7:07
pricing to your idea the ideal time to
7:09
apply it is at the outset of any new
7:12
project the next best time is right now
7:15
if you haven't already administered the
7:16
rapid viability test on your product
7:19
this simple 5-minute exercise could save
7:21
you months of wasted effort and drive a
7:24
renewed focus on your Beach head
7:26
customer problem and solution thanks for
7:28
watching and until next time take care
This one simple process helped me make
0:02
over 27 million selling simple digital
0:05
products and PDFs. And now AI can
0:07
automate nearly 90% of the work for us.
0:10
But here's what nobody's telling you.
0:11
Most people are using these AI tools the
0:13
complete wrong way. Meanwhile, my
0:15
students and I are making millions with
0:17
simple digital product PDF ebooks like
0:20
Lila, a 9 to5 who has a $27 ebook and
0:22
has done over five figures in digital
0:24
product sales without ever showing her
0:25
face. My name is Richard and 5 years ago
0:28
I was folding burritos for minimum wage
0:30
drowning in student debts. Today I run
0:32
multiple seven and 8 figureure
0:33
businesses and as of recently I was
0:35
featured in New York Times Square for
0:37
the impact that I've had in helping over
0:39
5,000 of my students build thriving AI
0:41
businesses. But here's the crazy thing.
0:43
You don't need to be an expert and you
0:45
don't even need to build a single
0:46
product yourself. And that's why there's
0:48
no prior experience required because I'm
0:50
going to show you the exact system in
0:52
this video that my top students and I
0:54
are using to turn any idea into a
0:56
profitable digital product in less than
0:58
7 minutes. Set up simple sales funnels
1:01
that run on semi-autopilot. And I'm
1:03
going to show you how to scale this to
1:04
10,000, 30,000, even 100,000 a month.
1:07
But here's what makes this difference.
1:08
I'm going to build an entire product for
1:10
you live in front of you using the same
1:13
exact AI system that I've used to do
1:15
over 20 million in sales. So, first we
1:17
need to find what people are already
1:18
buying. Now, you have two options here.
1:20
The first option is you can find what's
1:21
already proven. What are people already
1:23
interested in? So, I'm going to go on
1:24
Instagram right now and I'm going to
1:25
search in productivity tips in the
1:26
search bar. Now, look at these numbers.
1:28
1 million views, 2 million views,
1:29
500,000 views. As you can see, people
1:31
are obsessed with productivity content
1:33
right now. Option number two is you can
1:34
start with what you're personally
1:35
interested in. If you like fitness,
1:37
cooking, investing, great. If you like
1:38
it, chances are there are thousands of
1:41
people online also interested in it as
1:42
well. So, let's go with something that's
1:44
already proven. Productivity is
1:45
absolutely exploding. So, for today's
1:46
example, let's use that. Now, here's
1:47
where most people fail. They see what's
1:49
popular online, but then they have this
1:51
limiting belief in their mind that goes,
1:52
"But I'm not an expert." Watch how AI
1:55
completely destroys that problem
1:56
forever. I'm going to open up Chad GBT
1:58
here, and I'm going to type I see
1:59
productivity tips are trending, so help
2:01
me create a specific ebook concept that
2:03
solves a real problem for remote
2:05
workers. Narrow down the audience and
2:08
key pain points. Now, look at this
2:09
response. In 30 seconds, Chad GBT just
2:12
gave me a target audience, their pain
2:13
points, emotional triggers, concepts,
2:15
taglines, and even a title for the
2:16
product. We just went from productivity
2:18
is popular to a specific sellable
2:20
product concept without ever needing to
2:22
be an expert. I'm going to ask Chad GBT
2:24
now to format this as a product builder
2:26
prompt. Now, this is where everything
2:28
changes. What used to take weeks now
2:30
takes minutes. Now, I'm going to open up
2:32
an AI tool called Allen AI. This is my
2:34
personal favorite, the tool that my
2:35
students and I use for all of our
2:37
digital products. Now, go into the AI
2:38
product builder section. as you can see
2:40
here and paste in that refined concept
2:42
from chat GPT. Now watch what happens.
2:44
It's creating the entire ebook
2:46
structure, introduction, chapters,
2:48
actionable strategies and worksheets all
2:50
before your eyes done for you. This
2:52
isn't an outline. This is literally the
2:54
entire product for you. And look at the
2:56
quality, the specific routines, real
2:58
strategies, actual value people can
3:00
implement immediately in less than 3
3:02
minutes. We have a complete value pack
3:04
PDF ebook ready to sell. Now I'm going
3:06
to download this PDF from Aleni right
3:08
now. Could I sell this as is?
3:09
Absolutely. But let me show you how to
3:11
package it to make it look even more
3:12
professional in just a few clicks of a
3:15
button. Let's go to the free tool,
3:16
canva.com, and let's add a professional
3:18
cover graphic and format the pages
3:20
properly. Boom. Just like that, we
3:22
transform AI content into a product that
3:24
people will happily pay for. Now, this
3:26
is where a lot of people get stuck
3:28
because they start thinking, but how do
3:29
I actually sell this? Well, this is the
3:31
breakthrough. Allen.store. I'm going to
3:32
upload our ebook here. And the platform
3:34
asks for basic product information. And
3:36
look at what it creates automatically.
3:37
The moment I put in the name, I put in a
3:39
price point, it will now make a
3:40
professional sales page, a custom
3:42
checkout system, an email delivery so
3:44
that when people buy, they will get the
3:45
product sent over to them. All the
3:46
customer support is handled inside. And
3:48
here's the genius part. This simple
3:50
ebook becomes the gateway now to a
3:52
complete funnel system because this is
3:54
how the funnel works. The customer will
3:56
find your content and they get a freebie
3:57
resource. Then they get nurtured by that
3:59
freebie resource. So then they buy this
4:01
ebook and we could price the ebook at,
4:02
let's say, $47. Now, the moment that
4:04
they buy the ebook, it will then
4:05
redirect them over to congratulations
4:07
thank you page. And that thank you page
4:09
will have a calendar for them to book in
4:11
a 15-minute call with you. And on that
4:12
15-minute call, you answer the
4:14
questions, you give them value, and you
4:15
can sell them a 997 product or a 497
4:18
product. And that is how you turn one
4:19
ebook sale into a high ticket 497997
4:22
sale. And if you're thinking, "But
4:23
Richard, how do I get people to see this
4:24
product?" Now, this is where the content
4:26
viral feature of Alani becomes
4:27
absolutely incredible. I'm going to go
4:29
back to Instagram. Remember how I showed
4:30
you those videos about productivity that
4:32
were popping off like crazy, made by
4:33
other creators? Well, I got to find out
4:35
what's the most valid content out there.
4:36
So, here's an account with thousands of
4:37
followers making productivity tips.
4:39
Shout out to him. So, what I'm going to
4:40
do is I'm going to copy their URL and
4:42
I'm going to go over to Allen AI's
4:43
Instagram search feature. I'm going to
4:44
paste the URL. I'm going to hit enter.
4:46
And then I'm going to filter by views.
4:47
Take a look at this. Allen AI will now
4:49
show me their top 20 all-time most
4:52
performing videos. So, I don't have to
4:53
waste hours scrolling through trying to
4:55
find the most viral content myself. Now,
4:56
here's a game changer. I click write my
4:58
version and in 10 seconds or less, Alan
5:01
AI will literally write my own version
5:03
of a complete video script modeling
5:05
what's already proven to work. So all I
5:06
have to do is shoot the video or I can
5:08
use AI tools to create an AI avatar to
5:11
actually make the content for me. So I
5:12
don't even have to record the content
5:14
myself if I don't want to show my face.
5:15
And Instagram's algorithm will push this
5:17
video out to thousands if not millions
5:19
of people for free. No ad spend, no huge
5:22
following needed. And remember, you're
5:23
not copying. You're doing what I call
5:24
Eminem. You're modeling after what's
5:26
working. And the top creators all do
5:27
this. And Allen AI does all of the heavy
5:30
lifting. So, here's a breakdown of how
5:31
this actually turns into real money. One
5:33
ebook sale, 47 bucks. Three sales a day,
5:35
that's $4,200 monthly. Add one backend
5:38
997 program and two sales of that on a
5:40
monthly basis is an extra $2,000. That
5:43
means you just made $6,230
5:46
from one product. But it just compounds.
5:48
It keeps working for you. That ebook
5:50
keeps selling and Ellen store handles
5:52
everything automatically for you. This
5:54
is exactly how I built my AI business,
5:56
over 100,000 a month in peer profit, and
5:58
my top students and I are absolutely
6:00
crushing it. Priscilla went from a
6:01
stay-at-home mom to over $20,000 in her
6:04
second month. Lila, a college student,
6:06
balances with her 9 to5 job, did over
6:08
$13,000 from her dorm room in her first
6:10
3 months. I
6:11
made about $5,300
6:13
in the past two two and a half months
6:16
that I started. I made $900 in like the
6:18
span of 7 minutes. It was absolutely
6:20
insane. the difference between them and
6:22
everyone else. They had access to this
6:24
exact AI system. But let me be honest,
6:26
this isn't a magic button. You still
6:28
have to put in the work. You still got
6:29
to post content, help people, add real
6:31
value. But what used to take months now
6:33
takes hours. And what required
6:35
expertise, now you just use simple AI
6:37
tools. What needed thousands in ads,
6:39
it's all done organically now with zero
6:41
ad spend. The question is, are you going
6:43
to watch videos about AI replacing jobs,
6:45
or are you going to use it to protect
6:47
yourself and build real wealth? I just
6:49
showed you exactly how to create and
6:50
sell digital products with AI. You could
6:52
literally start right now. But if you
6:53
want to cut shortcuts of years of trial
6:55
and error and get access to Alan AI in
6:57
the complete system and get one-on-one
7:00
personal guidance and accountability to
7:01
hit 10,000 a month or more, I want you

7:51
exact full step-by-step process of how I
7:53
went from zero to over a h 100,000 a
7:55
month in profit from this AI strategy
7:58
selling done for you digital products,

sessions because we've got such great guests but also because it's a wrap up in many ways and a lot of the elements
1:32
that we've talked about in the other pieces of the startup series are going to come together tonight now that doesn't mean to say that for
1:38
those of you who weren't here for those other sessions you're going to be left out and i'm going to explain how you can get access to all that content too
1:44
thanks to the ilab and the great work that they're providing here but first of all very importantly i want
1:50
to welcome our guests so one of them is at least planned to be late but the other three are here so we
1:56
are lucky enough to have an alphabetical order from a period mark laurian and he was previously
2:03
svp over at uh spot fire and and working as part of the tibco group so mark if you just want to raise a hand and say hi
2:09
so who knows who you are uh welcome uh we have from demandware uh james driscoll who's our head of
2:15
marketing there and jameis will be uh no no uh uh surprise to some of you who've seen
2:20
his great work at the eye lab before and then our guest tonight from um hubspot our ceo brian halligan brian
2:27
if you just want to raise a hand so who knows who you are too welcome so delighted to have you here um a bit
2:33
of fun later on my brother actually hopefully will show up when he gets through traffic is going to cover one of his favorite subjects
2:39
which is part of the building a sales and marketing machine so i think you'll really enjoy that too so between us what
2:45
we're going to try to do is to bring to life a framework around what the various different elements are
2:50
of building a go to market strategy but it's a huge subject and so i just want to make sure that you know
2:56
all of this content is available in much more detail on the website and i've had a lot of questions over the
3:03
last few weeks from many of you have attended the previous workshops about how do you find what content when's it updated and all of that so i'm going to
3:09
take you through a quick tour of that and by the way lest i forget it for those of you want to tweet about our
3:15
guests all their twitter handles are there and the usual ilab stuff's always up the top so you can get at that stuff
Website tour
3:22
okay so quick tour on the website itself um and forgive me while we take a moment
3:27
on this you basically if you go to the site you can find absolutely anything by
3:32
going to the top menus and under startup secrets is every single one of the labs so for example if you went to the go to
3:38
market section you will find a write-up which i've actually printed out for you tonight to make it nice and easy
3:45
but at the top of that right up is the url if you want to go to it online and the idea here is that there's way more
3:50
content being built now that we can actually capture in one session so for example for those of you who were here
3:56
last year for the series we had a number of other great guests who covered things such as
4:02
brand channel and distribution we also talked about some of the key areas such as for
4:07
example how this relates to your business model and so forth all of that is available as resources on that page
4:13
and i'm not going to cover those tonight we're going to instead get into fresh material from our current guest stars
4:19
and so you'll find that detail here and i'll refer to it where i can but the idea is that we'll get more and more
4:25
content up there for those of you who want to keep checking uh we'll put a sign up form because i've had that request from people so you can get uh
4:32
notified when there is new content so thanks for all the interest i really appreciate there's been a lot of fantastic comments back we'll try to
4:38
respond to them all on the site and keep the content coming and thanks to our guests for contributing more this evening
Goal of the series
4:44
okay let's jump in so always um as you've probably heard me
4:49
say the goal of these startup secret series is to provide you a framework so that's not the answers and nor is it the
4:56
detail of everything that you might do to build a go-to-market strategy in fact as you probably have heard me
5:02
say if you've been here before what i really tried to do with this series was to think about what would it have been
5:08
like if 30 years ago as an entrepreneur i could have got some mentorship from somebody who could fast forward me
5:13
through all the mistakes i made and believe me there were plenty of those there's plenty of scar tissue to prove that but instead could actually share with me
5:20
some frameworks to think about the things that might be worth you know challenging myself to plan ahead of time
5:26
to deal with as a startup and so in the go to market uh space it's a pretty big
5:31
framework it turns out this is a pretty big part of the execution for most startups now i'll say ahead of time that this is
5:38
a framework that's mostly based around my own experience of b2b and mostly in software but as most of you have fed
5:45
back to me there are a number of you for example who want to do not-for-profit uh and ngo-type things and and have
5:51
interest in a broader sense so we've got case studies on that uh for example diagnostics for all who was here for one
5:57
of the workshops that case study is up on the site now uh we also had if you remember one laptop the child for those
6:03
of you here that case study is going up shortly and i'll continue to build the not-for-profit and other case studies
6:10
and i want to thank people like aloe can encourage others of you who are in the audience who want to contribute to those case studies to come share them with me
6:16
we'll put them into the framework and we'll try to bring this to life for those of you doing this in a not-for-profit way
Framework
6:22
but what i will tell you is a very simple thing in this framework there's basically a cycle that people go through
6:28
of figuring out how to find you from awareness all the way through how to purchase you and that's what's on the
6:33
left-hand side and there are basic tools associated with that the old world used to be all
6:38
about um outbound marketing and we're really excited to have brian halligan whose firm hubspot was one of the
6:45
pioneers in the whole science of inbound marketing which didn't even exist when i was you know embarrassed to admit my age
6:50
here you know back 31 years ago starting my companies but that's the point about this this is a living breathing thing
6:56
and there's no answer here it's just some things to think about so we're going to talk tonight consistently about you know what's the way to to optimize
7:04
as a startup the inbound versus outbound uh and again we're lucky enough to have mark lauren here who's going to actually
7:09
post what we actually have posted already his case study on outbound because there isn't time to go through
7:15
it all tonight but what we said was there's a bare minimum of things we wanted you to think about and these are
7:20
they first of all you really need to think about what your brand is and what you represent so we're going to cover that
7:26
secondly you've got to figure out you know what channel do you want to take that through and again that's almost invariably figuring out where you're
7:33
going to focus on target segments of the marketplace that you can be successful in and then i'm going to cover a couple
7:39
of startup secrets that i learned the hard way around personas and really getting very clear about who you're dealing with at what stage in the cell
7:46
cycle and then the bottom line which is really quite fun gets a lot of focus this evening intentionally which is it's all
7:52
very well to be executing on your marketing program but the hardest part about marketing is often measuring it
7:58
it's actually figuring out what's effective and the many famous quotes about this but i'll just get to the bottom line
8:05
here there is no substitute for measuring and iterating on your marketing program so we'll talk a little bit about how you do that and how you
8:11
might measure it and what are some of the ways that you can make this effective for you so that's our framework for tonight and
Agenda
8:16
uh it breaks down into the following agenda i'm going to start with some strategic things like the brand and positioning
8:22
and then we're going to get into some tactical things like how to run that marketing and sales cycle and then we're lucky enough to have as i said a couple
8:28
of guests to talk through some of the execution of this all right jumping right in then we talked about
Brand
8:35
this in the first workshop your brand is one of the most important things that you can define very early on
8:41
in a startup but the question is why and for many for many people it's as
8:47
obvious as well your brand is obviously what you want people to recognize you for well if you're coke that's very easy
8:53
but if you're a startup and you're joe blow enterprises then you know it's not that easy and in fact presenting a
8:59
business card as a startup is the first challenge you have is that you don't have credibility until you build that
9:04
brand so how can you get effective and what i'm going to suggest here is that this is really a science unto
9:11
itself this is in fact something that you really have to think hard about in the same way that you think about are you a
9:17
diet coke or are you a diet pepsi lover do you buy apple or you buy dell and
9:24
what do you want to represent do you want to represent yourself as the premium brand with high margins or do you want to represent yourself as the
9:30
you know high volume low margin brand and there are many different things that fall out of that
9:36
like i said this is a big subject so this is one of the pieces of content that we're not going to go into in depth
9:41
tonight this is on the website we covered it in depth last time so you'll find a full explanation of this
9:48
you also find us talking about some of the fun brands in the consumer world like nike uh some of the ones in the
9:53
tech world like zipcar so that's all online and it's uh you can go to it from that handout i gave you the things i
9:58
want to point out tonight uh that are easy for us to just think about and we'll tee up our first guest which is
10:05
jameis from demandware is that almost all of us have heard of the idea of a vision and for those of you who are here
10:10
for that company formation session we talk about it in depth well brand does start with your vision although the slightly different thing in the brand
10:16
world is it's really about what are you changing in the world what is it that you're trying to make an impact with a
10:21
little bit different than how you're building your company although the two of course are very closely aligned and then the second key part is the promise
10:28
what do we promise to customers at the most fundamental level so what is if you think about thinking about this
10:34
something that we've covered that that might add to this value proposition and we cover the value proposition in that whole workshop so
10:41
the value proposition relates very closely to promise and then the piece that gets very interesting and exciting
10:46
that jameis is going to bring to life is the attributes of your brand what actually makes this a brand that people
10:52
can get behind and ultimately that's expressed in emotion personality and style
10:58
so i've glass glass uh sorry glossed over that quite quickly intentionally because we're gonna bring it to life as
11:04
i said with um you know what jameis said but i do want to bring out one key thing
11:09
that i hope will help every one of you as a startup there's a starting point that's really really simple
11:15
it's about you that is to say you the founders are going to be the brand whether you like
11:21
it or not by the way so get ready for that i mean people will identify the startup of you as
11:29
what you bring to the the uh the marketplace especially when you don't have a product initially and you're going out effectively to pitch yourself
11:36
so think about how you the founders your team and your culture and some of the things that we talked about in for the
11:42
company formation session can be embodied in your brand because it's actually one of the most truly realistic
11:48
and authentic parts of what becomes a startup's brand and so thinking about
11:54
that early will help you formulate what it is that people will take away from you
11:59
and then how you execute is actually what people will measure you on you know you can claim all the things
12:04
you want in the world but if you don't deliver on high value for example nobody's going to attribute that
12:10
to your brand likewise if you don't deliver on great customer service and you're trying to make that as a promise that's not going to be consistent and
12:17
we'll talk about how that important that is so to bring this to life i happen to be in the boardroom
12:22
of a public company of mine demandware and so i'm going to tell you right now because it's public we can't disclose
12:28
all of this information on the site and we had a real live case study sure enough uh we were at the demand web
12:34
board meeting and we were talking about a company that's now you know an eight year overnight success having gone public this year could evolve its prime
12:41
its brand what could we do to move the needle now that we've become a substantive company uh with market
12:48
leadership position to really accelerate the next stage of our brand so with that i'd like to introduce jameis to uh bring
12:54
it to life and tell us how did he do it
13:00
thank you michael can everyone hear me okay it's a chronic fear as a marketer that you're not heard so it's the kind of
13:06
thing that i like to check whenever i start talking so thank you for the intro i'm here to talk about a living case study so this
13:13
is ongoing right now and what i want to do is take you through some of the rationale that we
13:18
had about our branding and take you through some of the you know analysis that we did and then ultimately show you
13:24
a couple of instances about how we're starting to execute it um and the execution is not yet live so you guys
13:29
are getting a sneak peek at a lot of this let's bounce this along one more good so
Branding
13:35
um as michael said earlier early stage when you're a smaller organization it's very easy to sort of deal with branding
13:41
particularly when you're in a marketing organization of just a couple of people because you are the brand and you can make these brand choices along the way
13:48
and you just sort of know instinctively whether something's what you want to represent or not but as you grow as an organization and
13:54
as in in our case we got a much larger platform now with a much larger microphone it was time for us to look
13:59
back and really institutionalize the brand you know what are the brand attributes of us that we
14:05
wanted to build equity around as we execute in lots of different markets and so what we did is we looked back at
14:12
and did an analysis with our customers and the broader market to get a sense for what are the attributes that we're
14:17
known for and also what are the challenges that we have in the marketplace and what are the things that we're trying to get done
14:22
and i'd summarize it simply by saying that we're here to try and change the criteria in the buying cycle so
14:28
demandware in this case as an e-commerce platform company was selling into a market where there was already sort of a
14:34
software space but we were doing this in a very different way which was to deliver this as an on-demand service so our goal in
14:40
our marketing and in our branding is to help the market change its mind and change its perspective about how it
14:46
evaluates us and thinks about us so this is overall for us about how do we build on what we've done and change the change
14:52
the criteria you know for us it was about and i'm not going to go through each one of these
14:58
things but a sense of both moving from how we had marketed in the past and also how buyers thought about it
15:04
to this new set of things that we wanted them to consider you know from cost to advantage
15:09
from managing software to growing the business for mid-sized companies to really the
15:14
sense of high-growth brands and so our challenge was how do we then sort of move from the left-hand side all
15:21
the way over to the right and get people to think about things differently when we did an analysis of the market
Market Analysis
15:28
what we saw was that everybody for the most part was playing in the blue boxes
15:34
where everyone was talking about either e-commerce or technology and talking about it as either features or benefits
15:39
and occasionally we'd see people that were moving to the upper right and the upper the lower right and the upper left
15:44
but what there is was this great opportunity in the green squares where there was this intersection of what are
15:50
the rewards that individual buyers want you know what are their aspirations what are their goals and how do those align
15:56
with the big objectives of these large retail organizations which is really around the brand and their marketing so
16:02
what's that intersection between the reward for the individual and the broader objectives of the
16:07
business and that's where we saw and think there's a tremendous opportunity to brand the
16:13
company differently so i'll explain that a little bit more what this meant for us
Emotional Connection
16:18
was we needed to move around and move beyond some of the broad claims that we were making the marketplace and really
16:23
substantiate them not just moving the claims of our software but also talk about what it was going to do for individuals personally
16:30
we think one of the great opportunities in enterprise software now is to start talking about the emotional side of
16:36
software right what does software allow someone to do to fulfill their own dreams their own
16:42
ambitions their own goals we think about this in consumer technology all the time apple of course
16:48
is the case study for this where we use iphones because they're cool well couldn't enterprise software be cool you
16:54
know we're spending a lot of times as buyers here and this is we're making strategic bets here couldn't we
17:00
make enterprise software something that individual buyers would aspire to and want
17:06
and the ultimate success of that would be if they were in the cocktail party or talking to their peers and they were saying you know
17:11
i'm using demandware right and that was that sign of sort of personal expression so to get to that level of sort of
17:17
emotional connection to buyers we wanted to position the company around a lot of their ambitions and goals and dreams to
17:23
sort of get to that word of mouth and sense of pride that people have when they're really connected to a product
Positioning Branding
17:31
so one of the things that we looked at was when it comes to positioning branding it's not just about you know how the customer feels about you but
17:38
how does the product or how does the brand make them feel about themselves and so in the case you see here here's a
17:43
you know a kitten looking in a mirror and seeing a lion we want the buyers to sort of have that sense of you know what they think about
17:50
themselves is reflected back uh based on the selections that they make right so that's what we're trying to get to
17:58
and michael talked earlier about the actors we look at as sort of somewhat who are the actors that we see in the
18:04
buying cycle from the head of e-commerce to the ceo or cmo to i.t or finance
18:12
you know and what are their sort of rational reasons for buying um you know there's a long-standing axiom in
18:19
in marketing which is people buy on emotion but justify with fact
18:24
so these are generally the facts that people think about when they justify a purchase
18:29
whether it's finance wants better economics or the ceo is talking about the growth of the business but what
18:36
they're really thinking about are sort of the emotional quotient behind that what are the things that they really
18:41
sort of want to feel about themselves whether it's i.t wants to feel like they have a much
18:46
stronger seat at the table or the ecommerce person wants to build their career to be able to move up to the ceo
18:52
level or ceo really wants to be you know thought of as a leader to watch
18:57
our goal in the branding is to sort of attach ourselves to those aspirations that they have so that when they think about their
19:04
career growth they attach that to our brand okay
Brand Promise
19:10
so our brand promise the you know the pillar in which we're really building comes down to this concept of potential
19:16
right that we as a company and a provider are are the means that they're going to use to
19:22
achieve whatever their dreams are right their potential as individuals their potential as brand
19:28
we want them to think about us as the canvas in which they're going to write them or paint that masterpiece
19:34
so that's largely what's behind our brand strategy is to attach ourselves to
19:39
their dreams so the customer benefits from this in a couple different ways you know when
Customer Benefits
19:45
e-commerce traditionally has been you know thought of with very big software infrastructure and laborious processes
19:52
what we're coming to is a sense of look if you if you can think it you can do it if you have an idea you can put it into
19:57
action right no matter there's no limits there's no worries there's no no no
20:03
surprises there's a sense of if you have a dream you can do it and to sense that freedom and give people the give the
20:09
buyers the sense that geez this is this is the right thing for me to invoke all my great dreams i just need the right
20:16
tools for that so our promise rests on really four basic pillars and
Our Promise
20:23
i'm not going to walk through each one in detail but the sense of innovation we can help them
20:28
innovate faster and better simplicity it's not hard it's easy partnership we're in it with them for
20:34
the long haul and performance and that we're here to support their ongoing success
20:39
so underneath each of that of that major promises this four are four major pillars if if if you will that we
20:46
continue to pivot to and articulate to let them know that this is what underpins what we do and why we make the
20:53
claims we do so i'm going to skip a little bit into
20:58
some of the sort of advertising and give you a sneak peek on how this brand is starting starting to roll out if you go
21:04
to our website now you'll see it's very black right but so now you're going to see a couple of different colors and i'm going to
21:09
explain in concept a couple of things that we're doing here to sort of bring that brand to life first you'll notice
21:15
is the colors green and gray green as innovation growth gray as steel strength
21:22
you'll notice that the customer's brand imagery is portrayed heavily it's not about us it's about the customer's brand
21:28
so you'll see that everywhere in all of our our ads and our marketing is it's not about us it's about them
21:34
and in the language here we have is we'll you'll see a pattern coming up which is the customer always comes first
21:41
their brand and their comparative verbs which is whatever they view is
21:46
important to them those the verbs we use comparatively we do it better we help them do it better with is a statement of
21:53
partnership and we come last right as the partner so this is a repetitive formula that we use in all of our our
22:00
marketing to sort of help convince and show the brand that it's about them it's about their
22:05
brand it's about their goals and we're here as an enabling partner we're here to help them amplify whatever it is that
22:11
they want in a new website that you'll see soon this is starting to roll out even more
New Website
22:18
so the statement you'll see on the on the home page is great brands have great ideas
22:24
we help make them possible right so it's that sense of complimenting the user complementing the viewer
22:30
complimenting them on the strength of their brand and what their ambition is and just to let them know that if they want that we're the partner for them
22:40
and more examples of that that i showed earlier you know perialus or lanzand these are
22:45
all the comparatives that we're starting to roll out now what we think is a position of strength for us is
22:51
these brands are willing to let us use their brand which is
22:56
pretty rare in software so instead of us talking about our features and our functions we're here to show who
23:02
are the partners that we work with and how they're willing to let us use their brand which is a tremendous
23:08
statement of partnership and that rings loudly in the marketplace
Summary
23:14
so in summary what i'd say is when you think about branding a lot of times we often as marketers stop at features and
23:20
benefits and we think that's where it goes the ultimate measure of this is when you
23:26
get to the reward right what is the emotional quotient that a buyer looks at
23:31
because that's the thing that really people sort of resonate with and it creates this sort of emotional connection people always justify with
23:38
fact but when you sort of strike the emotional cord it's a tremendous advantage and that's really where the power and strength of
23:44
brand comes from okay terrific thank you very much james
Challenges
23:52
so what's great about that hopefully is it brings to life some of the real challenges but i'm sure all of you would love to
23:58
fast forward straight to the point that jamie says to be able to talk about customers as partners to you but the reality is
24:04
many of us are going to start in a very different place we aren't even going to have our first customers and so where do
24:11
you start you haven't even got a customer maybe you haven't even got a product and you've got to figure out how to get to that pla place that jameis was
24:18
articulating so clearly there well before i give you that answer i just want to point out something that
24:24
actually uh the demandware promise was made very early on uh you know literally as i said eight
24:30
years ago and it wasn't really any different it's just that we didn't have the customers
24:35
to back it up so we made a lot of those same brand promises and had many of those same
24:41
attributes around simplicity empowerment etc it's just that we've now reached a point where we can actually talk about
24:47
them with a customer viewpoint and customer voice and bring that emotion to the full
Consistency
24:52
so let's jump to what you might think about it's one word
24:57
consistent startups think they've got to have 10 different things that they go sell in order to sort of overcome the customer's
25:04
objection actually the opposite is true what you want is to find the one simple
25:10
thing it's often referred to that a customer can attach to that they say wow okay that's different so we're going to
25:16
talk about that in different forms tonight but the point being at the start if you can
25:22
pick at the earliest point and play in in time in your business what it is that you're going to represent and stick with
25:29
it consistently then the more likely it is that will actually resonate with people so
25:35
we've already talked about this there are values that you probably have built in your culture those things we talked about for example
25:42
discussed do your customers come first do people come first do you stand for service for example or do you stand for
25:48
technology these are key decisions that you make early on you can bring these into your brand very early on and you
25:53
can make them part of how you represent yourself then what comes out of this which is so important i've mentioned it already in
26:00
terms of execution is that if you are reliably delivering on those promises you will get known for being a
26:07
simple and obviously highly disruptive vendor if you're enabling new capabilities and
26:13
so the trick here is for you to identify these things on as as early as possible and try to stick with them as be and be
26:19
as consistent as possible that's the one thing that a startup can be accountable for right from the get-go now for those
26:25
of you who weren't here at the uh culture workshop there's a whole section where we talk about values and teasing
26:31
them out and it's a fun thing to do i actually recommend that you do the same thing for this except not internally you go
26:38
and do it externally go spend some time with your first select set of customers and have the discussion with them about
26:44
what are the things that they actually are looking for that are not represented in the marketplace that you might be bringing to them that will stand out as
26:51
the first set of values that makes them want to do business with you so that's the mistake i usually find startups
26:57
doing they're doing this in the lab whereas what you want to be doing is doing this in the field and asking your customers what's missing if you can do
27:04
that and if you can pull out some of the items sorry the attributes and the the
27:09
opportunities that are out there and distill them into something that is authentically what you can bring to market and that you're going to
27:15
represent you're going to be starting in a good place so hopefully that makes sense as a first startup secret
Impute
27:20
now to put this in perspective um i have a second startup secret with you for you which is
27:26
start how you mean to end who recognizes that logo
27:31
this is a test to see is awake all right dumb question hopefully everybody does although it has changed
27:38
but not much right all it's done is lost its color believe it or not apple started their
27:44
branding statement in 1977 that's a long time ago
27:50
it even predates me which is kind of cool uh so the fun part about this is actually i remember this discussion very
27:56
well when we were all you know going through the process of figuring out how to launch my first company which was you
28:01
know selling applications on the apple ii which was you know so how do we relate to this thing you know what what is
28:07
apple all about well they had this one magical term any of you heard the word impute
28:13
anybody care to to mention what impute means does anybody know
28:18
i'd never heard of it i had to go look it up but it turns out it's been critical in apple's branding impute is
28:24
basically saying that whatever your product or service is apple will impute the value of it which
28:29
means immediately make you aware of the value of it and so if you notice when you open an apple product even the packaging
28:35
is imputing the value of apple's product being clear and simple and very straightforward and right out of the box
28:41
delivering value that's what they're trying to impute they're trying to make sure right from the get-go one of their
28:47
brand promises which is this just instant value comes across from the packaging
28:52
so i'm not saying you have to be apple but the point is apple didn't go back 10 years later and say oh we should you
28:58
know impute the value of our products and make everything simple right from the get-go they made that decision and
29:03
mike markler who actually did this was very key in the early stages even though jobs always gets the recognition
29:09
in bringing this discipline into apple and if you read the story which is a fun one you'll see that it really reflected
29:14
quite significantly early on in even product design and that's of course what we're here to talk about is how does it
29:20
reflect in everything you do so hopefully that's given you a sense of why brand is important and why it's very
Positioning
29:26
strategic and where you might start which is hopefully with a vision to where you'll end so let's move on to our second section
29:33
this one is actually i think very straightforward but at the same time also very fundamental it's all about
29:38
positioning now hands up who thinks that they could position their startup
29:45
absolutely uniquely today anybody go ahead
29:53
you've got a new way to do compensation do you have any competitors not that we're aware of that are direct
29:59
competition okay that is a very valid statement now let me ask you another question and by the way thank you for
30:05
being so bold to step up i always appreciate it um are there other people solving the problem of compensation in
30:12
the marketplace today are there people solving the same problem as you today in the marketplace
30:17
uh yes there are okay so there are other players does the caster customer have
30:24
suddenly a new budget therefore for what you're doing or are they going to have to find money from an existing budget
30:29
they will have to find money from an existing budget where an incremental improvement on what's out there already
30:35
there now okay you said we are cutting helping them cut costs
30:40
so we're actually a cost saving proposition rather than a study problem very helpful okay
30:45
so thank you very much what i'm going to do is just take that example and tell you this
30:50
is the biggest challenge i hear over and over again with startups which is in other words it's you're not
30:56
unique in this in this problem we think we've got something unique but guess what we're in a category that
31:02
already exists where there's a finite amount of dollars that we've got to compete for that basically means we're
31:08
going to fight it out with everybody so this section is all about well how do you actually avoid fighting it out with
31:14
everybody let's see we can answer your question what you're trying to do in the first
31:20
part of positioning is occupy a distinct place in a potential customer's mind
31:25
so if the customer like can identify that what you do is unique you're in a great place but if they say
31:31
oh there's 10 other vendors who help with compensation we've got a challenge and that's where you go on to the second
31:37
thing which is to say well what unique white space can i find in the marketplace
31:44
now for those of you here in the value prop session we actually spent a bunch of time discussing this and so i'm not
31:49
going to go through this all again you can find it again on the website we talked about how can you write that out in a way that at least positions you
31:56
for a unique set of customers with a product that is differentiated that does
32:01
something that's not been done before unlike the other competitors and talks a little bit about the whole
32:07
product in other words the entire solution that you delivered to to make that possible so with that in mind i want to bring
32:14
mark up uh from his experience at spot fire as part of the tibco organization to
32:20
talk a little bit about how did he do this and then i'll come and generalize it and try to address your opportunity
Mark
32:26
mark welcome thank you michael um you know positioning statements like
32:31
this they may look academic when you're in the audience looking at these frameworks but i can tell you they're
32:37
far from academic you really do need to to get a handle on how you're going to you know how do you
32:42
want to position and how do you want to differentiate your your product or solution out there
32:48
and i think you should go through this early and often frankly you know particularly
32:53
when you know when you're forming when you're launching when you're pivoting a lot of organizations you know when you
32:59
start a startup you know the the ultimate path that you're on is very unlikely to be the one
33:04
that you start on so when you sense that the organization is going to go through a change is going to try to reach a different market a
33:10
different buyer come up with a new solution i think it's good and healthy to go through these these sorts of
33:16
exercises in fact i'm going through one with a new management team that i'm on tomorrow
33:21
i've been with one of michael's portfolio companies for about two weeks and our
33:27
organization is going through a pretty significant pivot you know we're changing the profile and the persona that we go after so what do you think
33:33
happens these things unwind right when you when you when you try to reach a new buyer you're thinking about
33:39
the value that you offer you have to go through and think about each line each word in this framework should be
33:45
meaningful and mean something and i think when you get it right they're so aligned with the opportunity
33:51
and the value that you're conveying in the market and the differentiation over a competitor that if you were to read it
33:56
from a competitor's standpoint the whole thing would fall apart it wouldn't make sense so mark just to give people a bit of an
34:03
opportunity to get a sense of it what did spotify do and why was this tough for you and how did you solve the
34:08
problem here yeah good question so spotfire um was a private company were acquired by
34:13
tibco in 2007. about 2005 we went through a very significant pivot i had recently joined
34:20
the company we were targeting mostly scientific users in the data visualization space
34:26
right so we were selling to small teams of people scientists you know people in corners of organizations we wanted to
34:32
pivot and go after the executive ranks we wanted to sell into the business intelligence space
34:37
which had you know bigger budgets bigger dollars we believe we could get more scale we
34:42
thought the product itself would be able to serve those needs but we were virtually unknown in that
34:48
space anybody who knew that brand thought about us as a scientific and a technical and a technical product and as
34:54
often as the case as founders or early stage people you love the features so people tend to
34:59
gravitate to talking about what the product or the solution does not what it does for the target buyer so
35:06
when you go through exercises like this you want to think about who are we really really trying to reach there may
35:11
be a number of personas but you have to pick one you can't segment too tight especially
35:16
in an early stage organization so who are we trying to go after what keeps them up at night what are they
35:22
dissatisfied with that's going to be enough for them to call us back or to do a web search to try to find us or to
35:27
respond to an outbound you know email or call or something like that how is our approach different than the
35:33
competition what lines can we take that our nearest competitor can't and as michael had pointed out often when
35:40
you're an early stage company you're solving things that are being approached by other companies as well and we've
35:45
just got a different take on it and for us we were going up against cognos and business objects in hyperion really
35:50
well-funded organizations you know big marketing budgets we were never going to get there by saying that we were another
35:57
business intelligence tool we took a slightly different angle which was around focusing on the value of
36:02
decisions that people would make in a product using spotfire we could help people make better decisions and that
36:08
was the value statement and i'd say you know jameis's points were right on that was the elements of the brand we were
36:14
fun to use we were easy we would enable users to make better smarter decisions in every corner of the company and
36:20
that's what we ended up really focusing on the you know on this on the positioning statement and we as a management team fought through this
36:26
thing it was ugly thank you very much mark so hopefully that gives you
36:34
and by the way the business intelligence space that mark was competing for was a very very
36:39
noisy space with very big players and yet mark's team was very successful at finding their unique positioning and
36:45
being very successful at building the business around it yeah question did you have to rebrand it to so that people now thought of spot
36:52
fire as something for the business and for the recent scientists oh yes
36:58
yeah yeah we uh we there was definitely a rebranding effort for sure and i think you know going through the same process
37:05
that james had outlined but for me it started here we weren't going to move
37:10
forward until we had alignment on the management team here when we did that then we started going out in concentric
37:16
orbits and talking with the organization but everybody in the company was tested on this literally the ceo would
37:22
get in your face if you couldn't recite this this framework and i mean that you have to believe it that strongly and
37:28
then things like branding and campaigns and programs fall in line they're much easier to scale up because you're you're
37:33
kind of singing from the hymnal here if you will so back to that point earlier on one of the things that this
37:39
discipline provides is a consistent framework again that consistent word being the key
37:44
one for you to think about everything you do in your marketing which is why i say bring it up so early on now again
37:50
for those of you who weren't here for the value proposition session we spent a ton of time talking about this framework and how you build the various different
37:56
components of it so that's up on the site but this is how it ends up playing out in positioning
38:02
now i promised i'd answer the question for the gentleman he was bold enough to step up and say you know he's doing something unique in the uh compensation
38:09
world but uh i would i don't want to put this on you right away and i wouldn't try to get you to instantly articulate
38:15
it that way although if you want to you're welcome to stand up and say how you might define that up to you
38:21
do you want to take a try go for it all right let's go after app
38:27
for ceos and upper management at midsize and large enterprise
38:32
who are having trouble driving behavior for their employees
38:38
our approach is to integrate into existing meetings to
38:43
calculate impact of every employee using regular
38:49
weekly light minimal overhead approach
38:55
that i should have actually segmented that calculates impact
39:00
in a way that everyone perceives us fair and can be connected to compensation
39:07
unlike existing approaches which include performance evaluation approaches that everybody
39:12
hates everybody likes our approach their setup is
39:17
a new approach to performance management and compensation that
39:25
all participants appealing fair treatment improved engagement
39:32
and ultimately better performance for all players
39:41
i got to tell you to pull that off in front of all you guys uh you know on the spot that was very impressive it really was so thank you
39:47
very much i think you're going to do great i don't know what i'm going to say at this point other than you know great great starting point it really is
39:55
excellent well here's the thing about this you'll probably be doing it for the next five or six or seven or eight years until
40:01
finally you can stand up and people go what's the name of your company by the way fair
40:06
fair fair setup until everybody says oh yeah fair setup i know those guys they do the best compensation system on the planet
40:13
and it'll happen if you persist with that i think you can get there but that's ultimately what happens right
40:18
if i say coke to you i don't have to explain anything about it being a soft drink or fizzy or tasty you already know what it is but it took
40:25
a lot of money to get there and so that's why what we're doing right now is we're trying to figure out how do you get there
40:31
from the starting point that will make it most effective for you so let me jump in and start to add some value hopefully as opposed to just
40:37
asking audience the questions the first thing that i see that startups miss is this
40:43
everybody always thinks about that differentiation in terms of technology it's great that you might have a
40:48
technology differentiation in many instances it's a great starting point especially if it's a highly disruptive technology but it doesn't have to be
40:55
just about technology you could have some incredibly compelling differentiation just by figuring out a
41:00
segment that's never been served before so for example compensation is extremely complicated in the insurance industry
41:06
there's a lot of different channels it goes through there's a lot of different people have to take a piece out of it and there's a lot of different ways that
41:12
that calculation causes so many problems that it gave rise to a whole new set of companies we don't have to go into all
41:17
that example but that wasn't a completely new segment that gave opportunity for the business you're in
41:24
i would recommend that any business try to find that first segment that nobody else is targeting that could be your differentiation right there
41:31
the second thing is to find some kind of barrier to entry because believe me once the big guys figure out you're on to something interesting they're going to
41:37
come after you so what is it that could be the barrier to entry again most startups approach this and say well
41:43
we've got a better technology great but if it's just better faster cheaper somebody's going to come after you and
41:49
spend more money to figure out how to compete with you or at scale and so that isn't a good answer either but what's
41:56
interesting is that there are many things and we've talked about one of them if you were in our business model session that is very difficult for the
42:03
existing incumbents to come after in fact the larger they are the more likely they are to be titanically slow at
42:09
responding and one of them is business model if you create a disruptive business model that creates a
42:14
an innovator's dilemma the great book i encourage you to read if you haven't read it from clayton christensen you will see that this is an example where
42:21
even independent of your technology if you come for example with an open source solution the way our case study acquia
42:27
did at the last uh discussion and offer free versus where people are spending
42:32
literally millions of dollars and therefore are becoming dependent as a business on getting millions of dollars
42:38
from their sales force and in margin to support their overhead you will disrupt them nothing to do with the technology
42:44
to do the business model and then last but not least what we want to try to find is something
42:50
that becomes sustainable to you and again what i hear a lot of the time is well we've got ip and patents it's great
42:56
nothing wrong with that but i'll tell you there are so many examples of where startups have better ip and even patents
43:02
around it but do you really have the energy and the resources to compete with an apple or a google or a microsoft or
43:09
whoever it might be in your in your business uh eli lilly if you're you know in the pharma space no you don't and so
43:16
even though you might have what it takes are you really going to press it wouldn't it be better if you came at it
43:21
with a completely different approach and you had for example the first network because you'd given away your product
43:26
free of existing compensation users that was providing a completely different way
43:31
to benchmark that nobody'd ever done before and that gave you a competitive advantage compared to anybody else that
43:37
was there because it was free open and now fully exploited and your core ip ended up being not technology at all but
43:43
data completely different game that would be defensible because nobody else had it so i really encourage you
43:50
not to get stuck in the trap of approaching everything with a technology bias but instead to think about these
43:55
key areas as to how to define or redefine the competition in a way that puts you
44:00
in a position to win so how do you map that well again for those of you here for the perfect pitch i go into this in more
44:07
detail but it's up on the web again what i like to do particularly because we're at harvard by the way is come up
44:12
with a 2x2 and think about the high low and this diagram is pretty simple it's
44:18
really about mapping your competitors you might use for example bubble sizing to represent their relative size
44:24
but the important point here becomes the axes and the axes are always something that people put up in exact ways that we
44:31
just talked about well we're faster or better or we're cheaper it's okay but it doesn't work in the long run
44:38
what we want however we get there is to find this white space that nobody else is occupying that's what we're talking
44:43
about i recommend the thing you really spend time on is this
44:49
it's the barriers the barriers should literally cause the competition to say
44:55
they can't move from where they are to where you are so what's an example is your software sas
45:01
yes okay every on-premises solution that's not architected for multi-tenant remote
45:07
development customization etc is going to find it really hard to move into the cloud and be offered as a service
45:15
so on-premise and sas is a great example of a barrier for anybody in the software world who knows what i'm talking about here i can
45:21
tell you it's very difficult that is the entire premise on which a company called demandware that just presented got to be
45:28
worth you know nearly a billion dollars why because the existing incumbents who
45:34
were offering e-commerce stacks which was a lot of technology that was sold on premise required people
45:40
to go and build all that technology and customize it and guess what retailers and merchants don't do that what they
45:46
spend their time doing is trying to distinguish their brand merchandise and market better and they don't want to deal with all that technology so that's
45:52
all pain to them whereas the gain should be getting straight online and customizing the site to their brand's
45:57
look and feel that's all demandware did one fundamental barrier between the two though which is one's on premise and the
46:04
other one is obviously uh in the cloud so those are the kinds of barriers we're looking for here and you've already got one which is great
46:10
obviously we can think of a couple and i mentioned before they might be business model uh or they might be different axes here
46:17
then that gives you a chance to put yourself in a position where you will be unique and defensible
White Space
46:22
now the white space thing is what we're going to talk about next how do you find that white space what is it that makes
46:28
it possible for you to have some unique position and this is really all about the third
46:33
key part of the workshop targeting and segmentation so why is this important
46:38
well if i could define the perfect startup storm it would look like this
The Perfect Startup Storm
46:44
you would have a disruptive business business model the way we talked about in that session you would certainly have a disruptive technology
46:50
but you would also have a new market and some great way to approach it in a go-to-market sense
46:56
and in the at the middle of that there would be a tremendous opportunity for you but before i get into the opportunity
47:03
here's the piece that i want everybody to make sure they don't lose tonight most startups are really struggling with
47:09
the amount of resource they have to go after any market so let's ask the obvious question is it better to go after a big market or a
47:16
small market anybody
47:21
more yep i'm not going to challenge you again but yeah big okay let's have your viewpoint for
47:27
big if you're going to go into market and somebody's going to compete into this market you'd rather take a big space and
47:33
even if you occupy a meaningful amount of it it's it's a substantial
47:38
market for you i think that's a great answer you were going to say somebody else say small go ahead say it's small for a
47:45
startup because if you can own that one small
47:50
market you can start to tap into other markets after you you know sort of broadcast your value
47:57
proposition one very good yep very good anybody else want to chime
48:02
in before we move on obviously what two very different viewpoints there right i actually think
48:08
they're both right but the trick is to figure out how and where and when they're both right so
48:14
the real challenge is as i posed right at the beginning if you're a startup you have very little resource to do a lot
48:20
with and so if you're going after a large market you want to serve all the needs of a large market you're going to
48:25
be very very challenged because no matter what anybody says large markets will have diverse needs by definition
48:32
very rare it's not the case but if you can define a nice small segment and that's the key word
Big Market Small Segment
48:38
so if i'd been fair i would have said big market small segment then your product market fit your
48:43
packaging and pricing your channels of distribution to reach it and your messaging communication can be that much
48:49
more focused on those unique needs and so you'll be much more effective
48:54
with a limited amount of resources yet i will tell you again challenge each of yourselves to think about this
49:00
early on because it's one of the biggest problems i see with startups is they start way too broad and then all of these things are challenged not just
49:07
building the right product but then how do you price it and package it for all these different varieties of people within this big market
49:13
also how do you pick the right channel point uh channel and distribution point to get it leveraged through and what should be the
49:19
message in communication when all these different needs are out there it's really tough but if you can segment to the point where you've only got one
49:26
particular target then you can message directly and so forth and so that's why this is such an important
Recap
49:32
model and it's why i actually really want you to think about a new way of thinking
49:37
about uh this value prop as we talked about it before all the things to recap that you were
49:42
here for those of you here that we talked about discontinuous defensible disruptive solutions those all still apply but remember we said there are
49:49
four u's those of you here unworkable unavoidable urgent problems are the best to solve
49:55
and the last one was underserved in an underserved market where there isn't a really good solution right now now if
50:02
you put those back together again what you end up with here is a model that is right at the core of
50:09
this something that i think all star startups should look for but i don't invent all the terminology
50:15
in this world and i'm sure many of you read or heard of um eric reese's book where he talks about
50:22
the minimal viable product so the minimum viable product is
50:27
something that obviously comes from figuring out what's the minimum you can do for your customer but i would argue
Minimum Viable Segment
50:33
that the minimum viable segment is just as important but the minimum viable segment overlap
50:39
with your product will make it possible for you to target a much smaller area and i don't hear anywhere near enough
50:45
work going on in this area when i see startups getting going they spend all their time saying okay how can we get the basic functionality right but if you
50:51
don't know who it's for what does it mean doesn't mean anything if you know exactly the persona of the
50:57
person for whom you're solving that problem by segmenting this way you can nail it but this is usually left out
51:04
so mvp is important mvs is just as important and i really encourage you to spend time understanding that
51:10
so what is a minimal viable segment how do you get that how do you find that
Common Set of Needs
51:16
this is the next startup secret it's one simple thing it's a common set of needs
51:23
so a lot of people tell me oh no no i've got a segment it's finance or even better still i've figured it out
51:29
within finance insurance okay you know what it might be that but what if those people in insurance have a
51:35
completely different set of needs you know person to person you probably haven't found a segment
51:41
but by contrast i've seen some great products that span right across industries you know insurance banking
51:47
and completely different applications maybe even sales and marketing but they have a common set of needs and that might be for example very close customer
51:54
intimacy might be as basic as that that's what you're looking for you're looking for a place where the customers
52:01
when they sit down and say hey did you use this product they can say yeah i love that
52:06
and the common need kicks in and say oh well i better try it then and when you deliver on it they reference each other and say yeah i had
52:13
a fantastic experience then the next guy says well then i should try it as opposed to well that's great but doesn't
52:18
meet my needs so why should i bother trying it and that's where the dissonance occurs is if you haven't figured out your
52:24
segment to be these same needs but by contrast if you get this working
52:29
you'll get this reference ability happening customers talking to each other saying yeah it met my need oh it
52:34
met yours too it meant yours too oh wow these guys must be the leader in this segment hey big deal and you end up
52:40
having your initial beach head and to the gentleman who raised it earlier dead right it becomes the place where you can
52:46
build because you've now got credibility with a set of customers and that let me tell you from 30 years of experience is the
52:53
biggest challenge that startup has is getting that first set of referenceable customers to say yeah you delivered on
52:59
your promise that brand you stand for bang on it's actually making me more successful as a customer
53:06
so let's dig in a little bit more i've already given you a bit of a clue on this the typical answer
Vertical vs Specific Needs
53:11
and a startup has is to talk to think about this in vertical terms there's nothing wrong with that you know maybe you have
53:17
a perfect solution for uh you know automotive or government there's nothing wrong with that at all
53:22
it's also possible to think about this in completely different dimensions and i'm just giving some examples size for example you mentioned this thank you in
53:29
your you know a bold attempt to obviously get through the positioning statement that you were going after a certain size in the marketplace that's
53:36
totally appropriate too but again what if we could get to a much more specific need that everybody has
53:42
i.e let's stick with the conversation example if people had to get their compensation approved in a certain way
53:49
to meet regulations that might span across a bunch of industries but if it was something that had never
53:54
been done before and that users could reference each other it could be really interesting so sometimes these are talked about as
54:00
diagonals because they cut across industries it doesn't matter what your terminology is the key thing is getting these consistent needs and so i really
54:07
encourage you not to give up on segmentation until you can answer that problem and not to get distracted by
54:12
verticals or sizes or anything else they may play an important part in your segmentation but in the end you need to
54:17
look a couple of customers in the eye and say do you both agree that you have the same need and then if they do you're
54:23
onto a winner so there's a lot more detail on this on the website i'm specifically skipping it tonight uh just to give our guests more
54:30
time but what you'll find we talk about up there uh in one of the case examples is how do you find a critical need
54:37
because back to the value proposition you know finding something that is urgent and underserved etc all the other
54:42
four years that we talked about is much more interesting obviously than just finding one that you know people not not in a hurry to solve or
54:49
it's not that painful for them so that's up on the website i encourage you to spend some time looking at it we cover
54:54
this particular case example so what's the startup secret out of this i wish
55:00
i could distill this word even more that i'm going to share it with you focus
The Startup Secret
55:09
everybody's looking at me like yeah does anybody think there's any more
55:14
important word for startup okay either i will put you to sleep or
55:20
nobody's going to challenge there must be at least one more word that's more important money
55:25
i don't know well okay you don't need to challenge me i really don't think there is it turns
55:31
out the biggest challenge that we see with every startup is obviously figuring out where to focus uh and thinking about
55:37
that beach beachhead but why because the number one problem i see literally the number one problem i see
55:44
in execution with a startup is people try to go too big too fast and they end up contracting on failure
Vision vs Execution
55:52
so just think about this for a second which would you rather expand on success or contract on failure
55:59
i mean yet this is the number one issue we run into people spend way too much time with
56:05
a grand vision and starting on too broad a market opportunity with not a clear enough
56:10
defined value proposition that's positioned correctly to a minimum viable segment to start to build that initial
56:17
set of referenceable customers that can make the success and you said it earlier thank you you're dead on so it sounds so
56:23
simple but it is the most important thing that i'd encourage each of you to try to find a chance to do now last time
56:30
i give this session i had a bunch of people send me email afterwards and said that's great but you talked all about vision
56:35
and we've got to have a big vision and what do you what do you mean you're talking about both sides of your mouth here so i've put a new post on the site
56:42
it's called vision versus execution and it answers that question at least in terms of thinking about the two the
56:49
bottom line is on it that you need both they just have a different time scale your starting point needs to be
56:55
incredibly focused your vision in the long term for years out can be as broad as you like defining you know how you're
57:01
going to dominate the world in the future but don't go to customers with a vision and try to sell it
57:07
go to the customers with the first set of needs that you can answer uniquely well and then talk to them about if
57:14
they're seeing that success how they might enjoy the vision with you that will will hopefully answer the question
57:19
that i got many many times in email but thanks for the question for everybody who threw it in there all right well we've got through the
Sales and Marketing Cycle
57:26
strategic session and now we're going to get to the piece that hopefully gives you some tangible basis to think about
57:32
how do you go about addressing what we talked about which is the sales and marketing cycle and this is a cycle that many people
57:39
define in different ways it doesn't really matter what i've got here as the terms i'm not trying to be
57:44
specific about these except to say that almost every buying cycle starts with somebody finding you getting awareness
57:49
of you and goes through some set of steps like interest in you understanding what your proposition is engaging with
57:55
you to figure it out trialling it in some way to see if it really delivers and ultimately hopefully purchasing it
58:00
well if it does all those things if you do all those things excuse me you will obviously find a way at some point
58:07
to be you know building some repeatability what we're going to talk about now is a couple of things i've learned along the way that typically
58:13
gets skipped over the first is personifying it so this is like the next level down from segmentation and again i
58:20
often hear people completely skip this so i'm going to come up with a couple of terms here that make it easy for you to
58:25
remember hopefully the word i use is actors and that is to say
58:30
there are various different stages that the customer goes through when they're dealing with you so think
58:37
about actors on a stage just that's the reason i came up with that analogy and the customer actors are very
58:42
different through this cycle in fact it's usually what people forget so for example right
58:47
at the top of the cycle if you're an early stage startup you'll often be dealing with visionaries these are people who are looking for
58:53
competitive advantage from this breakout proposition that you've got visionaries are great but there are very
58:59
few visionaries who sign checks unfortunately not always the case i mean you might get lucky
59:05
and it's something obviously you can find it it's great what you'll usually find is the guy who writes the check is actually an economic buyer and maybe
59:13
again if you're lucky he's the decision maker but he probably has a boss too especially selling to large enterprises
59:18
or even if you're not even if you're in a not-for-profit and you're trying to sell to for example a foreign government trust me this gets even more complicated
59:24
uh which is one of our case studies so what i encourage you to do is figure out well who are you dealing with are you
59:29
dealing with visionaries are you dealing with technocrats people who actually evaluate the technology the people who have to operate it to actually
59:34
operationalize this to get it working the influences which is sometimes different again the people who have if
59:40
you like the political clout in the organization the economic buyer or the decision maker and again i'm not trying
59:45
to say these are the only categories but it's just to get you to think about the kinds of actors you'll be dealing with and why it becomes important
59:52
is that do you really think you're gonna have the same message for all these people i see lots of heads shaking why not
59:59
go ahead because they're motivated by different things absolutely the the guy who's at the visionary is
1:00:05
probably trying to get some competitive advantage in his you know thought process to convince people that he's on
1:00:11
the right track this guy down here probably doesn't give a damn about that he's just very focused
1:00:16
on some kpis that he's got to meet to get you know paid off at the end of the quarter and he's he's probably feeling this
1:00:23
guy's a nuisance so the very different motivations here uh the guy who's operating is not at all interested in
1:00:28
how much it necessarily costs he's essentially does it run efficiently and and think about this guy he doesn't
1:00:34
even give damn with his technologies better he just wants to know that it's cheaper and faster and all those other things that makes it possible for him to
1:00:40
get the best deal they're just different motivations and yet again i see the startup world obviously you know
1:00:47
approaching this and saying well we've got a great value proposition but they're not thinking through how they're going to apply at these various
1:00:53
different stages now one of the things i want to point out is that the bottom line the purchase
1:00:58
is actually made ultimately by everybody coming together and we refer to that as the decision making unit the dmu
1:01:05
and good sales people know what a dmu is they figure this out early but i encourage you as well to be thinking about this who is the dmu who's the
1:01:11
group of people that when they come together will ultimately say yeah we've got to buy this and once you figure out what that group
1:01:17
is and what the politics are you'll figure out how to get to the next key startup secret and that is
1:01:24
how do you qualify early and often can anybody tell me why this is important i mean it's all up on here but
1:01:31
just tell me from your gut instinct happy to ask one of our guests if they want to chime in here why is
1:01:36
qualification important early on you don't like the freshman resource thank you jameis
1:01:42
geez you should be a vp of marketing and a great company
1:01:48
what's going on here is is you know you're taking customers through a lot of different steps so imagine if
1:01:54
you take them through all these steps and you find out you really didn't qualify that they have the pain and need and the right decision-making unit to
1:02:01
actually take you to the close wow you just could waste have wasted three six nine sometimes more months and
1:02:08
all that resources of precious startup is just lost yet that's what i see happen in most
1:02:14
startups they don't spend enough time defining that target segment that minimal viable segment that we talked
1:02:19
about against which by the way you qualify the customer to figure out whether they're going to be somebody you
1:02:25
can meet the need of and therefore you know there's so much time lost so qualify
1:02:30
early save all the time and money up front qualify often because things change
1:02:35
and i really do mean that like as startup times you know basic things happen like your economic buyer changes
1:02:41
from position to position in big companies or importantly learn as you're going through this about
1:02:47
what isn't isn't working and narrow your segmentation figure out you know what it is that caused somebody to drop out of the sales
1:02:54
cycle in fact i think the best questions asked of a startup are why didn't somebody buy not why did they buy so why
1:03:00
didn't they buy can help you narrow and then as sales qualifiers people have their own ways of doing this i'm not
1:03:05
going to get into this a whole area of itself whether they call it bant or man act which is what i call it uh
1:03:10
figure out who has the money the authority the need the ability uh who's the competition is and in what time
1:03:16
scales for example they're going to buy those those are pretty typical criteria that sales people will use to qualify
1:03:22
and when you're building your uh initial go to market approach the earlier you can get all those questions into the cycle to figure out you know who has the
1:03:29
money etc the better and that will ultimately lead you to figure out whether you've got a dmu that can actually move the needle
1:03:35
any questions before i move on i went very fast through a big subject there but it's such a fundamental one
1:03:41
and i'm happy to break out and do another session on another time yeah question at the back so there's
1:03:46
elements there that feels like for startup you need to have some very experienced marketing people to
1:03:52
understand how to manage those contacts um what would you say about that if
1:03:58
you're in a small team environment some of those pieces there i think and i would ever find somebody who can partner
1:04:05
with me who can do that stuff well i think it's great to find experience
1:04:11
but i will tell you that if you're opening a brand new marketplace with a brand new product there probably isn't anybody's got any experience and many
1:04:17
startups are doing that so that's why we try to bring these frameworks to the fore which is that even in a three-man startup you can
1:04:24
start when you do your first set of interviews with customers qualifying you know
1:04:29
who are the people in the organization that make these decisions what are their needs what are their pains what are their challenges etc so yeah of course
1:04:36
to answer your question it would be great if you could find that experience but i'm invested in a seed company right now that we haven't even put money into
1:04:42
actually that's busy in its earliest stages formulating what its value proposition is and they're actually getting out and doing all of this with
1:04:47
customers right now to figure out if they've got a minimal viable product and whether they've got the right segment so
1:04:53
i i don't think you have to be big i think you can start early i don't think you have to be experienced you just have to take this kind of framework and you
1:04:58
just have to keep that discipline up and if you do it right it'll fall out as mark said earlier on in terms of something very crisp that you can all
1:05:04
say hey this is our value prop this is our positioning this is our brand and this is what we want to stand for that
1:05:09
answer your question thanks great yeah one of them in the middle here uh
1:05:14
can we can i go back to the point that you mentioned uh startups should focus on figure out the critical critical
1:05:20
needs of consumers how to how do you define a critical need based on my observation there are
1:05:26
successful companies that are focusing on the needs that not critical that consumers can leave without it but still
1:05:33
successful one very recent example is fab.com yep great example designs to the people i
1:05:40
can leave i buy a lot from fab.com i can i can live without all these designs so that's not solving the critical needs of
1:05:46
consumers but they are still successful fantastic question and um i'm going to point you at a resource
1:05:52
that's on the site uh under value prop where we talk about aspirational needs uh and some some aspirational needs are
1:05:59
not critical they may even be latent uh i.u didn't know that you needed for example
1:06:04
you know fab.com to find you this new selection of products and services but once you see it you go wow i wish i had
1:06:11
that the other day there's a fantastic example it's the fastest selling product
1:06:16
ever in technology that met a latent aspirational need can anybody name what it is
1:06:23
ipod ipad iphone nobody knew we needed a pocket computer that had a gps that could measure every heartbeat that we
1:06:29
took every step we were we made etc but once you've got it you're gonna you say wow i'm not giving that up
1:06:36
uh so there are plenty of examples of those needs and what we talk about in that section is how to identify them
1:06:41
and in a consumer world they're very different than in the business world so there might be things like you know if
1:06:47
you follow maslow's hierarchy of needs there might be social needs for example the date they might be physical needs
1:06:52
they might economic needs you know need for recognition responsibility which by the way plays into your compensation
1:06:57
example you know people want to be recognized for for doing well so those needs complain as well and and the
1:07:04
framework is a is called black and white how do you identify you know uh latent and aspirational needs versus blatant
1:07:09
and critical needs so you'll find it on the site but it's a great question did i at least touch on the right answer if we okay great
1:07:16
um i'm gonna if you don't mind i'm gonna hold that question to the end just because i want to keep us on time we've got a bunch of speakers but please do
1:07:22
stick around and we'll answer it okay so what we've done here is to cover as i said some of the fundamentals that bring
1:07:29
you to the point where you've got to figure out what are you going to do to actually be proactively driving to market
1:07:36
and what i'm going to try to do is give you a framework to think about this so when when i hear startups challenged with you know what is the first set of
1:07:42
things i do what's the first set of activities i do you know most people think about oh well i should do some pr that's great that's that hits the
1:07:48
awareness thing but then how do you go take it beyond that get interest understanding engagement
1:07:53
so the reason i've come up with driving you'll see later on but you are in control of a certain number of things
1:07:59
and i call them gears that enable you to build momentum and if you think about yourself starting in neutral and wanting
1:08:04
to get to overdrive where you're just nailing customer after customer then what we've got to think about is how do you do that
1:08:10
well the first thing i'm going to tell you is unfortunately the customer controls a lot more than you do a lot more than you do otherwise this
1:08:17
would be easy they control the accelerator the brake and the clutch
1:08:22
this is kind of like taking your teenage daughter driving right whoops you want to quickly take control again
1:08:27
but unfortunately you can't the reality is the customer has these controls so what are they
1:08:32
accelerators are the things the customer needs from one step to the other they don't as it turns out move automatically
1:08:38
from awareness to interest you've got to give them a reason to do that you've got to find out how to move them from one step to another so for those of you who
1:08:44
are here for the business model session we talked about how you might do that with your product creating slippery products as we talked about them simple
1:08:50
low cost easy to install type products that make it compelling for them think about your own experience since we
1:08:56
talked about iphones where you download something from the app store and within one click you start getting value out of it
1:09:01
guess what you'll probably keep going with it you'll try to evaluate it and go to the point where if you're getting enough value out of it you'll purchase
1:09:06
it but what will be the breaks well it turns out in almost every buying cycle there are a lot of breaks and the things that stop the customer
1:09:13
moving from place to place are many it might be a bad product experience it might be the license is too difficult to
1:09:19
evaluate it could be so many things but one of the things i'd ask you as startups not to assume is that it's
1:09:24
price that is the weakest excuse of all yeah it can be price but these days it's
1:09:30
pretty easy to come up with freemium models so the real challenge is to figure out what's actually stopping the customer and as a startup the thing i'd
1:09:37
encourage you to do is one word actually i guess two on here since i've put it up so strongly actively listen
1:09:44
so we hear most startups tell us about how they got their first set of customers i'm actually much more interested here but what were the 20
1:09:51
that you lost along the way and why didn't they buy and what have you learned from that and how do you think you might approach
1:09:57
either a targeted segment better as a result of learning that from the sales rejections and what it is
1:10:02
that's stopping them because that's going to accelerate your cycle if you can figure out how to get them to take the break off
1:10:08
so spend time on that and ask the hard questions don't just you know skip over the customers that didn't buy they're
1:10:13
the ones that really matter and then this is the fun part there's a clutch here too unfortunately
1:10:18
customers often put the clutch in and usually they put the clutch in because they don't know what to do next
1:10:23
and it's amazing how many startups don't design this funnel as a complete flow in other words think about each step and
1:10:30
how each step needs to leads to the next one so it's really obvious for the customer that if for example you've got
1:10:36
an app to stick with that analogy and you want them to purchase something like an add-on in in-app purchase that
1:10:42
there's some value for them to do that like for example if they've bought your fit uh you know fitness monitoring that by
1:10:49
doing that you can sign them up to a community online which will give them benchmarking against other people are doing it it's a great potential thing
1:10:54
but if you don't lead them to that and tell them the benefit of it they're not going to take that step and it's amazing how many times i see
1:11:00
that clutch go in because nobody defined the next step so it's obvious but that's what this is all about trying to make
1:11:05
sure the obvious is brought to the fore so the thing that we skipped over was gears
1:11:12
once you know what the customer's doing with the accelerator and breaker and clutch the good news is you can put gears into action you can bring your
1:11:17
tools to market and the reason i use this analogy is people typically skip many steps it's
1:11:23
just like gears it's very tough to go from step you know neutral to fifth gear or straight to overdrive you can't skip
1:11:29
awareness interest understanding engagement and get people to go to purchase maybe you can accelerate it incredibly quickly so that people get an
1:11:36
experience that is so great from your product that they go through that cycle even in a few minutes but trust me it will be there people very rarely
1:11:43
spontaneously purchase something unless you happen to be looking at a fashion item and they just got to have it so
1:11:49
there are always exceptions to this but certainly in software in the technology world uh it's pretty much true
1:11:54
so obviously what we're encouraging you to do is think about what are those gears at every step and how will you
1:11:59
work with a customer um through them and for those of you here again to the for the value prop session i talked about a
1:12:06
bunch of those uh they're the things that you can give customers clear visibility into such as you mentioned
1:12:12
for example you are cost saving right yeah uh so cost savings one of them revenue
1:12:17
is even more powerful if you could show people how they make more money so one of the things about the demandware proposition that was so compelling is
1:12:22
that we can show customers how to convert online to generate more revenue from the
1:12:27
merchandising and marketing they're already doing as a service that was really what drove that first value
1:12:32
proposition for a month rather than cutting cost out of all the infrastructure that was put behind e-commerce yeah that's important but
1:12:38
when we told them we could generate more revenue they started paying a lot of attention and then there's all the obvious things like time people
1:12:43
resources etc there's one in there that's particularly applicable to startups just to pause on it anybody see
1:12:49
what it is what would be easiest for a startup to sell it's not that obvious go ahead compare them
1:12:55
yep dead on why because you're small and agile absolutely figure out what the pain is
1:13:01
and address the pain directly without being distracted it's it's well said i couldn't say it any better myself it also turns out that
1:13:08
remember we talked about visionaries early on visionaries in early markets are usually looking for competitive
1:13:13
advantage and they're willing to take big risks if you think if they think you can do something that helps them break
1:13:19
out and why because they want to obviously look good at that point and if it's
1:13:24
really an order of magnitude which is what we talk about in the game pain section or more they're willing to take that risk with you so that's an that's a
1:13:31
startup type of um gear that you can gauge if you can figure out how to show people competitive advantage early on it
1:13:37
doesn't necessarily play out later on in markets but certainly very helpful as a startup okay back to the customer side
1:13:44
what are the customers um issues that they use as accelerators and break well it turns out it's it's painful even for
1:13:50
customers to find startups which is why it's great to have brian here is going to talk about inbound marketing how we changed that but that
1:13:56
was one of the biggest problems before the web came along is how did you get people to even see who you were and what you could represent for them so that's a
1:14:02
cost um trying obviously your product engaging with you you know how you buy it whether
1:14:08
you make it simple for them to buy or complex to install and integrate and manage and everything else how you deploy it and so forth
1:14:14
all these are things that we talked about in the value prop session they turn out to be breaks that the customer
1:14:19
will use if it's difficult once you've bought the product to install it if it's difficult to purchase it in volume if
1:14:26
it's expensive that's obviously one thing we do but if it turns out breaks it's example really difficult to manage
1:14:31
so i give an example that actually spawned the entire company that mark is here representing a period it turned out
1:14:36
it was really fantastic to see the uptake of the initial apps that went out on the ipad to big companies
1:14:42
but once they got them out there they couldn't update them except by bringing them all back to to the uh it department
1:14:48
plugging them into itunes and updating the app really painful that's not going to work when you're estee lauder and you've got 13 000 kiosks around the world that have
1:14:55
got your your ipad deployed with the latest uh you know uh updates for your
1:15:00
cosmetics coming out every week so it just turns out these things are incredibly important think about what
1:15:06
might stop your cycle and again the framework here we've been through in the value problem the last one is fun remember i said
1:15:13
there's a clutch for those of you who are here in the valley prop session the clutch is the inertia it's the risk
1:15:21
of working with a startup at any point it's likely the customer could just drop out and say you know what ah there's too
1:15:26
much risk yeah it's a startup you know this isn't a big enough problem or this is too great a risk and the default that every
1:15:32
uh company has is to do nothing so you've got to remember that in a cycle so what is it you're going to do to get
1:15:38
them to take the clutch out and let you put a gear in to move them to the next step and be very clear about that if
1:15:44
you're going to find that every single step you will help them move all the way through the funnel and the real bottom
1:15:49
line here is unfortunately good enough is good enough and by default if you've got a good
1:15:54
enough solution in place you won't look at a startup that's why we always talk about having a gain pain ratio that's
1:15:59
got to be at least a 10x to get over the initial inertia of being a startup
1:16:05
okay for time's sake i'm going to cover this next section very quickly again those of you here in the last session on
1:16:10
business model will remember me talking about core uh the capabilities of really exceptional value that you have the real
1:16:16
core value you have and how do you put multipliers and levers around it these are exactly the things that again help
1:16:24
you if for example you've got multipliers around freemium products or channel parts that
1:16:29
can help you with the customer relationships or slippery products that make it really easy to buy and try
1:16:35
or technology stacks that pull you to market because you're part of a whole product those will accelerate you
1:16:40
through the buying cycle and lever examples are things that we're going to hear from brian and david about
1:16:46
that are how do you use new tools like the web and inside sales or even just you know good old high touch product uh
1:16:52
support and services to make it easy for the customer to get through without keeping pulling the brake on
1:16:58
and what i recommend you do to simplify all this is road test over and over again
1:17:04
people typically spend way more time on their product and honing their product than they do
1:17:09
road testing and the road test for me is this get out there and check how much time how many people what resources are
1:17:16
involved at every step of your cycle and accelerate as best you can with automation because if you keep having to
1:17:23
do this manually it'll never scale so figure out how you're going to automate whether it's with what we're going to talk about inbound marketing or clever
1:17:29
things like for example you know better use of crm systems and then figure out what your levers are can you for example
1:17:36
get channels that will help you accelerate can you get tools things like videos or podcasts that package instead of every
1:17:42
sales rep having to go out every time and pitch put it on the web figure out how to make it a podcast put it in a
1:17:47
self-service portal i didn't put it in this time but last time we talked about companies like symantec you've got literally a quarter
1:17:53
of a million customers being helped by actually one of our companies aquia with the self-service portal that
1:17:59
provides all the knowledge for them to move through evaluations really powerful and then use the multipliers that we've
1:18:04
talked about such as you know slippery products uh and clever packaging to actually make it easy for your value to
1:18:10
come right through very quickly so again more of this um then probably you have
1:18:15
time to get into tonight but if you take away nothing else tonight around the cell cycle than the following it is that
1:18:21
it's at least as important to road test your go-to-market as it is to test your
1:18:26
product and i don't see enough of that being done in startups unfortunately there's way too much spend on the technology and
1:18:32
not enough on the go to market so to bring this to life um mark very kindly agreed to share with us what did he do
1:18:38
when he was a spot fire and so mark come on up and share with us how you approach this great thank you so um
1:18:47
we had devised this uh this tool or framework called plays it was using a sports analogy so it takes you know lots
1:18:53
of different players on the team in order to get down the field as an example and the concept of play for us was how
1:19:00
are we going to go to market how are we going to go after a specific market segment focused like a laser beam
1:19:05
and and actually execute across the organization cross-functionally we're going to need help from the marketing team from the pre-sales organization
1:19:12
maybe we want changes in the product itself right and how we're going to actually execute our field organization
1:19:18
out there to pull this thing off and in the spirit of focus like michael is encouraging us to you know to think
1:19:23
about um at the time when i left spot fire we were you know well north of 100 million dollars it was an organization
1:19:30
it was playing in a number of different vertical and horizontal markets so we needed the ability to go to market in
1:19:35
each of those focused areas that was all part of that initial positioning
1:19:40
statement but even if you're in a small organization you may not have multiple plays to go to market i think there's
1:19:46
value in thinking through i'm going to jump through here just in the interest of time there's value in thinking through your
1:19:52
go to market strategy and summarizing it in one slide so if you think about the topics that michael was was was hitting
1:19:58
on the actors who are we going after what segment are they in what is the very specific audience
1:20:04
this play card that i'm showing you is a one slide summary of how spotfire went to market to reach risk professionals in
1:20:11
the financial services industry with our analytics product on the left hand side you're basically defining who are we
1:20:17
trying to reach what keeps them up at night what's the core message that helps differentiate our offering and what's
1:20:22
the competitive advantage that we bring distinctly over the next best competitor so it's essentially mapping out the
1:20:28
market strategy or the go to market strategy on the right hand side we'd force our teams to come up with the
1:20:33
tactical details to pull that off cross-functionally so that this wasn't a marketing led initiative but you'd get
1:20:39
even as a small company get people from different domains around the organization share with them the
1:20:44
objectives of what you're trying to do what are the accelerators and the brakes and the clutches for your business
1:20:50
help people in the organization understand what you're trying to do and you'd be surprised what what creative ideas come you know getting these great
1:20:56
ideas from the pre-sales group or the engineering group because they've got an idea of a clutch that you know that we
1:21:01
can help address by bringing and building into some of the go to market plan so we touch on the major
1:21:07
categories that you'd expect but again we force it in one page how are we going to create demand for the organization
1:21:13
are we going to equip our field organization or channels to capture some of that demand
1:21:18
you know what partners need to be enabled what product enhancements need to be built into this and and ultimately pulling all of this
1:21:25
together will help you reach that target segment and again in a bigger company you could have multiple play cards that you would run in a small
1:21:32
organization you should be satisfied by getting everybody on the same page and there can be detailed plans behind each
1:21:37
one of these things but get people on the same page focus on how you're going to market and make sure you understand
1:21:42
all of the levers that you're going to bring to bear to get through the the customer buying cycle mark just a good
1:21:48
uh that's great thank you very much how quickly once you've adopted these play cards did you get repeatability and what were some
1:21:54
of the things you got in the way of growth at spotify when you did this you know the it's a great question the
1:21:59
challenge that we had was that we were going after a couple of different actors in different markets and they were at different places in their buying cycle
1:22:07
so we could literally win clinical trials deal clinical trial deals at will
1:22:12
if i could get to the opportunity we could execute so the play looks totally totally different this particular one
1:22:17
here was about going into a market raising awareness and helping to you know build awareness and send it
1:22:23
into the pipe the clinical trials play delivered benefits immediately we would measure everything more of an uh of a um
1:22:30
of an awareness generating play like this took i mean we would it would take months in order to get demonstrable
1:22:35
results coming out of this but we'd measure top of pipe how are things you know falling through the waterfall do we
1:22:41
see any uptake early on are we people getting stuck let's inject another customer tool let's inject some other
1:22:47
piece of information on the website to help people move down the move down the waterfall touching on it quick i'm happy
1:22:52
to talk in more detail i found these really really helpful to really force decisions along the paths that michael was was outlining so thank you very much
1:23:00
mark i think i wanted to to bring out by asking that question is that i would encourage you to be patient with yourselves because
1:23:06
a lot of times you think oh well i've you know i've got three months to get a product out the door three months is not
1:23:12
a lot of time to road test your go to market unless you have very short sales cycles which of course i hope you do
1:23:17
maybe you can get down to you know days or weeks uh in in terms of sales cycles
1:23:23
and maybe minutes but if you don't you've got to be prepared to take the time to do the road testing and
1:23:28
give yourself a chance to explore the full sales cycle and that's actually even though you might think it's expensive and i see a lot of startups
1:23:33
saying oh god i can't take six months to do that that's so much time it's a stitch in time saves nine and if you
1:23:39
really figure it out early on you figure out how your qualification is going to work it will save you so much money down the track
1:23:45
so thank you mark you brought that to life very well all right well the good news is i only have one more section so
1:23:50
you can get rid of me and get the guests back on stage but it's a pretty important one this is
1:23:55
the results oriented measured executions i call it rome for short so why this is
1:24:01
so important is that unfortunately marketing is the one budget that most people look at and they go well that's discretionary
1:24:08
and in many instances it is unless you can prove what it is that's actually being delivered from it in terms of
1:24:13
value so this is how i encourage you to do this first of all measure every step you can't manage what you can't measure and
1:24:20
the first things you want to think about are obviously what we talked about time people and other resources but what becomes important is conversion rates
1:24:26
and all the things that i talked about the accelerators brake and clutch and gears are things that you should be measuring against how did that move the
1:24:33
conversion rate from one step to the other and if you can keep showing that this particular gear whenever you engage it accelerates and causes conversion to
1:24:40
go up from two percent to ten percent obviously you'll keep doing it over and over again so that's why we think about it that way
1:24:46
to look at it visibly this is really all about figuring out how do you get leads in up the top and a customer at the
1:24:52
bottom and so what we're trying to do is measure the time and resources and conversion rate at every step to figure
1:24:58
out what are the steps that make an impact and ultimately at the bottom how much did it cost you to acquire your
1:25:04
customer uh in time dollars and resources and you've probably heard this phrase now the cost of acquisition of
1:25:09
request of a customer that's really what this is all about and it's it's thinking about all the resources that go into
1:25:15
that and what at each step made an impact now as a startup what you're looking for
1:25:20
is one word flow you're looking for a seamlessly linked set of steps where the customer doesn't keep engaging the
1:25:26
clutch and you keep going into neutral but where every step is really obvious and it's obvious for them to move uh
1:25:32
from for example interest to understanding and how they can then engage with you and then trial your product and buy it and if you do this
1:25:39
well it turns out there's a very obvious secret you can't skip this step because if everything's not seamlessly linked the
1:25:45
next step will not work which is to reverse engineer it in other words if you know that
1:25:51
keeping it simple 10 of your leads convert to customers i wish it was that uh many companies are way off that but
1:25:57
let's say it's 10 then obviously to get 10 customers next week you're going to have to have 100 leads and
1:26:03
you're going to know what a various different steps you're going to have to take to move them through from awareness to purchase
1:26:09
so it turns out the really exciting thing about this is it is possible to do this much more easily these days than it
1:26:15
ever was you know back 20 30 years ago uh when my brother and i were first trying to do this and that's because the
1:26:21
web actually makes it possible to close the loop you can measure every step if you're doing for example all of this
1:26:27
online and many companies are doing just that and in fact as a result of that they're effectively reverse engineering
1:26:33
the process and saying well what is it that i need to do to build the business that i have and they can pre
1:26:40
uh if you like plan the costs and resources and so forth they're associated with it now when you come to us an investor by the way and you've
1:26:46
figured that out can you imagine how much more confidence that fills us with that now that supposedly discretionary line about
1:26:52
marketing is actually worth putting a couple of million dollars or 10 million dollars behind because you can show us
1:26:57
what it is that moves the needle so this is why this becomes so important so the web changes
1:27:03
nearly everything and i just want to point out a couple of things you certainly can measure everything you can create a closed loop and it's lower cost
1:27:09
so that helps with things like you know being able to do what i call the virtual sales and marketing cycle you know you
1:27:15
really don't need today to start out thinking about sales people and you know the six-legged sales call with an se and
1:27:22
and so forth but what you can do instead is to think about how would you automate everything and create everything as you
1:27:28
know webinars or videos and podcasts the negatives are and it's pretty
1:27:33
obvious but i want to state it unfortunately as everything's on the web your competitors also only one click away and
1:27:40
so you are going to get cost comparison you know price-based shopping all the kinds of things that go on all the time
1:27:46
and so you have to think about that you have to think about how all the things we talked about in competitive positioning play out on the web because
1:27:52
all of those become distractions with just one click and then i can't over emphasize this
1:27:57
enough i hear companies a lot particularly when they're selling more complex products skip the reality of
1:28:03
trying to do this without learning the customer interaction for themselves first for example they say oh yeah we're just
1:28:08
going to build an affiliate program the affiliates will do this that might work but if you don't first hand experience what the customer goes through in terms
1:28:15
of pain of adopting your product and learning for yourself where you've got to improve for example the experience of
1:28:20
the product the installation or whatever else you'll never refine it and you'll never move the needle in terms of making that whole flow that we talk about
1:28:26
really happen so there's no substitute at the end of the day for creating relationships and creating experiential
1:28:32
learning but the good news is you can do that on the web too most of this can be done you know whether it's via skype or even you know
1:28:38
interaction on webinars so there's a lot of things here that are really exciting about this new world and that gives me a
1:28:44
great chance to introduce our guest speaker tonight which is brian halligan who pretty much defined this whole term
1:28:50
of inbound marketing so welcome brian happy to have you with us
1:28:57
how's everybody doing everybody stand up i have atd and i'm like a caged lion
1:29:04
over there put your hands over your head okay stick your right out and do a little shake
1:29:10
left out do a little shake sit back down nice job nice job team
1:29:18
okay who's heard a hub spot okay cool so we got a crowd that sort of gets it
1:29:24
so this this idea of inbound marketing i really like this idea a lot it's a new type of marketing and um
1:29:31
there's sort of two observations behind it and the first one's driven um here anyone know who this
1:29:36
handsome guy is on the left famous guy come on you're harvard
1:29:42
business school here that's my dad and that's me on the right and if i just
1:29:49
i just the first observation that led me to this idea of inbound marketing is just this radical transformation in how
1:29:55
humans live and shop and learn there's been this ta this sort of tear in the fabric of the universe around the way
1:30:01
work happens the way we all live and shop and learn has radically changed and i think that the difference is showing
1:30:06
my dad i think about my dad he got a lot of mail every night he'd come home at six o'clock i'd sit next to him on the
1:30:11
bench and he would have his scotch and water and have a little cheese with crackers and he would open like all his
1:30:17
mail and read it i never opened my do you guys ever open your mail there's never anything in there that's useful he we got seven tv
1:30:24
stations channel two channel four five seven thirty eight fifty six if you get the rabbit ears just right you can get
1:30:30
channel 68 um and he talked on the phone a lot and just very different from all of us you
1:30:36
know i'm on twitter i'm on facebook i'm on linkedin i'm on gmail it's just a radically different way i work and live
1:30:42
and shop and learn uh so that's sort of my first observation i sort of came up with my my second observation is that
1:30:48
the playbook that marketers use almost all marketers use this um is pretty common
1:30:54
in the playbook is we're going to buy a list of email addresses and we're going to you know we're going
1:30:59
to bang people over the head an email we're going to hire a bunch of young and hungry telesales reps and we're going to
1:31:05
cold call people we're going to spend a bunch of money on advertising on google adwords or
1:31:10
whatever it would be we're going to hire a pr firm to interrupt journalists we're going to do tv as we're going to radio ads that's sort of the marketing
1:31:17
playbook and that playbook worked great for my whole career i sort of built my career on that i call it the outbound
1:31:23
marketing playbook there's only one problem with that playbook what's the problem
1:31:31
what's the problem what's the problem
1:31:36
with that with that playbook i mean it's the opposite of what you guys do i know but what's the problem
1:31:45
you're reaching a lot of people who don't want to hear your message people are sick and tired of being marketed too and they're sick and tired of being sold
1:31:52
too and they get really good at blocking it out whether that's a dvr at home or it's caller id on your phone blocking
1:31:58
the goddamn sales reps out whether it's you've got uh you you've got ad blocker
1:32:04
software now that'll block out the google adwords that doesn't work as well you've got spam protection software and
1:32:10
you've got a priority inbox with your gmail it's nearly impossible to reach somebody with the traditional marketing
1:32:16
playbook today you need to take that everything you learned in your marketing class here at hbs throw it away doesn't
1:32:22
work anymore completely rethink marketing to match the way humans actually shop and learn today and that's
1:32:28
what i call uh inbound marketing versus outbound marketing so if you start a new company
1:32:34
do it with inbound don't do it with outbound now there's a couple things i really like about this inbound approach
1:32:40
versus the traditional outbound approach with inbound your success is much more about the width of your brain than it is
1:32:46
about the with about the width of your wallet big companies have a lot have a big
1:32:52
thick wallet and a really thin brain small companies have
1:32:57
a big brain thin wallet inbound marketing is great for small businesses so you
1:33:02
people at hbs i heard i'm a sloane guy but i heard a rumor the hbs people have big brains and so you guys should be all
1:33:09
over this inbound marketing skills because your success is much more about the width of your brain than the width of your wall you don't really need any
1:33:15
money to be successful with inbound marketing second thing i like about inbound marketing is the way it scales so let me
1:33:22
let me walk through how i think most venture-backed startup marketing departments work here's how it works everywhere right
1:33:29
you get your prior pile of venture capital it's pile sequoia capital they put all adventure
1:33:35
in and the marketing guy's like great here's my plan i got my shovel hold on
1:33:45
and over here on the left that that's google adwords uh but it's really a furnace so i got my shovel
1:33:52
i got all the money and i throw it into google's mouth and google grows like crazy but you're stuck and you can't grow and
1:33:59
it's really hard to get the math work with adwords and this is how a lot of startups try to get the map to work it's
1:34:04
adwords and facebook ads just darn hard to make it work if you get it to work you put a
1:34:09
dollar in the machine you get like a dollar ten out of the machine really hard to get that math work the way inbound marketing works is very
1:34:16
different let's just say let's just say you're the ceo of ford
1:34:21
motor company if you're ceo of ford motor company you've got assets on your balance sheet what are some of the
1:34:27
assets on your balance sheet ford motor company assets on the balance sheet
1:34:35
factories inventory cash thank you david you're a very good student um things like that now let's say you're vp of
1:34:42
marketing or you're the founder of a startup what are the marketing assets you've got solution
1:34:48
that's crap hard tangible asset on your balance sheet if you're a marketer perspective
1:34:55
that's horse time or come on okay let me get let me give you
1:35:00
a hint links into your website what's another one
1:35:08
hbs twitter handle what like your twitter handle twitter followers is that what you said
1:35:14
brilliant what else facebook fans number keywords you rank for in google number uh pages on your
1:35:21
website those are hard tangible modern marketing assets on your marketing balance sheet and what happens is you
1:35:26
create an asset today create a piece of content today and it's a it's an asset that lasts forever in scales forever
1:35:33
it's it it pulls in customers and it lasts forever and it in in pulls
1:35:38
in customers essentially forever so it's not like you're renting that asset you own you own this asset you're not
1:35:45
renting space on google you're not renting space in some lists you're not renting space on facebook you're creating your own marketing assets to
1:35:51
become magnets that pull customers in people with me guys would be cool
1:35:59
okay the other thing i like about inbound marketing versus outbound marketing is people hate outbound marketing does anyone like getting
1:36:04
called at home at six o'clock does anyone like getting spam anyone like those television ads
1:36:12
sucks inbound marketing is great you create all this content and it's rich content it's informative and it pulls
1:36:17
people in and it's engaging so people fall in love with your brand like they fall in love with patagonia or they fall
1:36:22
in love with apple or they fall in love with whole foods these brands that people love that's you want to create a
1:36:27
lovable modern brand people are really sick of this traditional marketing
1:36:33
okay and so how do you do inbound marketing i've only got a couple minutes here so i'm going to talk about part of it
1:36:38
the first thing you need to do as an inbound marketer is is to create tons of content the idea
1:36:44
is you got to turn your website into a modern magnet by creating tons of remarkable content blog articles genius
1:36:51
brilliant blog articles ebooks webinars things like that and if
1:36:56
your blog article is good or your webinar is good or your ebook is good it'll pull people in and the better it
1:37:01
is the more retweets they'll get the more facebook likes it'll get the more links it'll get the longer it will sustain the more leads it'll pull in
1:37:08
it'll be really really awesome so the key to being a modern genius marketer creating tons and tons of remarkable
1:37:14
content you market you market today think of yourself like disney or fox or cnn like your production studio so think
1:37:21
of yourself like a production studio turn your brains into customers
1:37:27
what's this
1:37:35
who said that you said that what's your name viva your goddamn genius
1:37:43
that is the internet what are the dots pages
1:37:48
customers they're pages they're they're websites okay
1:37:53
and the big white ones are big websites what are what are the what are the lines between the pages
1:38:00
links the more the more links you have the more visitors you'll get the more
1:38:05
authority you get the more mojo you get and the way i kind of think about it is links are to the internet as dollars and
1:38:11
cents out of the economy how do you get a lot of links into your website good content brilliant content what's
1:38:17
your name genius bill's a genius remarkable content here's what you here's what's going to happen you're going to start
1:38:23
your company and your website's going to be like cambridge massachusetts right it's like cambridge mass how many how
1:38:29
many airports in cambridge zero how many how many like bus stations real ones
1:38:36
none train stations highways
1:38:41
a couple two highways you want to turn your website from cambridge massachusetts to new york
1:38:46
city how many how many airports in new york city yeah two three whoppers train stations
1:38:54
yeah you got penn state a lot of big train stations how many bus stations the bus stations are twitter the train
1:39:00
stations are facebook uh the airports are linked in the highways are links from other websites so to be a
1:39:06
remarkable modern great marketing people love that scales you have to be able to create a lot of content
1:39:13
anyone know what this is this is i used to live in japan this is the imperial palace in japan and i took
1:39:20
this this picture because it reminds me of my favorite philosopher my favorite philosopher is a guy named
1:39:26
warren buffett what warren buffett says to his ceos is you want to build a moat around your business you want to build barrier to
1:39:32
entry uh barriers around your business like michael was talking about and the modern moat around your business
1:39:38
the way he says that i really like it's like you want to make them out make it really wide make it cold and put sharks in and alligators and wider and colder i
1:39:45
think the modern moat around your business i totally agree with michael isn't a patent isn't a trademark it's
1:39:51
this inbound marketing stuff how many links into your site how's that growing how many keywords you're ranking for how
1:39:56
many facebook fans how many linkedin fans how are you getting them converting down the funnel that stuff's really hard to replicate and it reminds me of a
1:40:03
company that i really like uh called zappos when i think of zappos let's just say i
1:40:09
wanted to start a company to compete with zappos and i was gonna you and i were gonna start it we're gonna start we're gonna what's your name
1:40:15
we're gonna bury them you and i were gonna bury them we could we could figure out a lot we could get the a good-looking website and
1:40:22
hire a designer we can get their funky culture right we can get the inventory we get the supply chain the thing that's
1:40:28
bare for us to compete with is tony shea the ceo he's got six million twitter
1:40:33
followers their website's got 500 000 links into it they're they have five million keywords they rank for that's a
1:40:40
nearly insurmountable competitive advantage for the two of us to compete with that's what i wish for you an
1:40:46
insurmountable competitive advantage go for inbound marketing really works
1:40:56
i don't know about you but i feel like i need to rush out and buy something that he's selling whatever it was i'm buying
1:41:02
i'm in too late i think i think a smarter brother got there earlier
1:41:08
wait if you want to learn more inbound marketing book you can check out
1:41:14
or go to hubspotmarketinggrader.com you put your url in there and it will give you a grade of one to one hundred on how good
1:41:20
or bad you are at this stuff and then if you like this stuff i teach you class it's sloan on it's a it's a
1:41:26
half semester class you could cross register for it that's him thank you very much we'll try to put all
1:41:31
those links up on the site so everybody can get to them great stuff so there is no question that
1:41:36
as people think about this there are a lot of challenges to adopting this model just on its own and there are people who
1:41:42
talk about inbound as only being suitable for a certain deal size we don't believe that's the case it's not really to do with deal size it's to do
1:41:48
how you approach this thing but it's certainly a question worth posing so as a counterpoint we didn't have time to
1:41:53
get into it tonight but mark was kind enough to produce a document that's up on the site that you can go connect to
1:41:59
which is how can you also use this to get the best of all worlds in a hybrid model because there are certainly
1:42:05
instances where outbound still makes sense it's not just a you know one size fits all so that can be found online at
1:42:10
the resources under go to market outbound marketing and again it's all up on the website if you want to just click
1:42:16
on it there so thank you mark for doing that and sorry we didn't have time to fit it all in tonight by the way
1:42:22
yeah be tough to follow that act i'll give you my two steps on that uh giving me the hook no this is good
1:42:28
this is what we're here for let's say your salesforce.com or your ibm you've got a big brand and you start
1:42:34
cold calling people have heard of your brand they might pick up your phone you're some little startup out of hbs that no one's ever heard of selling
1:42:40
performance management software you are really that's an extra special waste of your time
1:42:45
um so i think outbound marketing actually starts work as you get bigger in the early days that they hit that
1:42:50
startup excuse them so i feel a debate raging there which we need to get into but but actually i
1:42:56
think it's it's a it's a great piece of advice and uh maybe what we'll do is we'll set up that debate for some some fun another time but thank you very much
1:43:02
um and thanks mark also for contributing that okay so on the last section here and um
1:43:08
uh quite excited to introduce my brother david who's been a a fan of building this notion of a sales and marketing
1:43:15
machine for some time and really has taken what many people used to think of as an art and created a science out of
1:43:20
it and i think it's so helpful to hear from him why this is possible because it's not just about size it's back to
1:43:27
that thought that brian just articulated so well which is if you use your brain early on you actually really can turn
1:43:32
this into a sign so david great to have you here welcome
1:43:40
hey good evening everybody pleasure to be here um so one of the things that i want to do is a little bit um
1:43:46
covered by mike but i'm going to cover it again in a slightly different way for you here so if we think about what the basic of a
1:43:53
funnel is here i think it's really straightforward you take a bunch of suspects and you put them through a bunch of stages and you
1:43:59
hope to get somebody that's a closed deal and once you've got a closed deal you then want to do the reverse part of
1:44:04
that which is to try to expand that so you get the entire usage uh potentially get some upsell
1:44:10
uh in that process there and so interesting thing here is if if we were in a perfect world for all of you as
1:44:15
marketers you would be able to get all of that done in one single step and how many of
1:44:21
you would like it if we could put up a website which looked like this where we put up a small video of our product
1:44:27
and told you that it cost nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars and said buy it now so interesting question here is why does
1:44:35
this not work can you ask answer that question for your own particular products if i can grab somebody in the audience who's got a specific startup
1:44:42
and a product here to tell this audience here why this would not work for their product
1:44:48
yeah because you're not targeting the buyer you're not you're not targeting the the market
1:44:54
a specific enough segment to answer their question you're right but imagine for two seconds here that you have got
1:45:00
the right buyer who's targeted on the site what stops them from feeling comfortable
1:45:06
to click the button there right then and there
1:45:12
go ahead they see the price before i see the video without the product
1:45:18
so they're worried about the price they're not sure if they're going to get a return on investment on the money would be one price can scare them for
1:45:24
city what is the product trust like how do they know that they can trust your product trust is a
1:45:31
fantastic word that was very well done thank you very much so they're very concerned about can they trust you and
1:45:36
can they trust your product to actually work would be a key one yeah there are multiple stakeholders who's going to make decisions
1:45:43
excellent thank you very much indeed that's a very good one yeah people usually want to dig deeper and i don't there's nothing else for you to do
1:45:50
on this page so there's you can play the video again kind of information so why do they want
1:45:55
to dig deeper what what information do they need to find that they're looking to dig deeper for
1:46:00
it could be credibility it could be but i think people in the purchase decision make a process that need multiple cycles
1:46:06
of confirmation until they've reached a point that they're confident that this is going to be
1:46:12
okay so uh let me you're dead right but the thing that i'm i'm trying to get you to do is to tell me exactly what they're
1:46:19
looking for when they do that digging so you have clarity in your mind about precisely what questions they feel they
1:46:26
need to have answered before they're going to be comfortable to actually buy your product do you see where i'm going with that
1:46:32
yeah from other customers affirmation from other customers why do they want affirmation from other customers what
1:46:39
are they trying to solve there is is this some human emotion that you can think of that that's going to make them feel
1:46:45
better about how they want to be in and with whatever is you know and what about fear of failure do you think they might
1:46:51
have a fear of failing yeah i think that's one of the big ones is that the looking at other customers takes away
1:46:56
some of that fear from them yeah yeah and if social proof in addition that also makes them not
1:47:02
have to make decisions themselves to see that a lot of people with similar needs have succeeded that they can
1:47:08
short-circuit their evaluation up and say okay and slightly succeed for me as well yeah that's an excellent recognition there yeah one
1:47:15
last one at the back how it can help them out in solving their problems yes exactly is this
1:47:22
actually going to solve my problem as opposed to is it merely going to be some cool thing where i can watch some cool video so what i was trying to do there
1:47:28
was some pretty simple which is i'm trying to get you to step out of the way you think about the world
1:47:34
and put yourself into a customer's brain to try to understand what's going on in their brain when they are asked to buy
1:47:41
your product and if i can recommend this to you i would strongly suggest
1:47:46
writing down every one of these points particularly for your product yes so it might be things like is it going to
1:47:52
integrate with salesforce.com are my people going to be able to actually work this is there a good
1:47:58
return on investment but fear is one of the greatest things that you've got to overcome fear of
1:48:03
failure and fear of of themselves looking like idiots because they brought something into their company that that didn't work uh and overcoming that so
1:48:10
that's one of the key things that we want to have is that list of things that have to be satisfied before somebody
1:48:15
will buy your product and to me the art of marketing is really figuring out how to take what should
1:48:22
have been that one step with the instant buy button and designing the series of steps that will allow you to effectively
1:48:29
accomplish answering each one of those questions for them so when we think about trying to design
1:48:34
these steps here michael already covered this for you i have a much simpler buying cycle in him i think his is excellent
1:48:41
mine just has three stages in it awareness consideration and purchase let me give you a little
1:48:46
example of what we're thinking about here how many of you have gone um let's say you're going to pick up your kid
1:48:52
from school and actually i don't think anybody in this room has kids so it's probably not applicable but you've been wandering around town waiting for a train and you
1:48:59
want it into a store without any intention to purchase and within five seconds of getting in
1:49:04
the door a salesperson came rushing up to you and started trying to convince you that
1:49:09
these sweaters here would look fabulous on you and you really should consider buying them and won't leave you alone
1:49:15
and all you really wanted to do is wander around the store can anybody tell me how do they feel when that experience
1:49:21
happens to them it's not fun is it right it's not an enjoyable experience to be sold to so
1:49:28
that's a really interesting thing here the more i ask people about this the more clear it becomes that people really
1:49:33
don't like to be sold to but let me give you a different example you are out at lunch you accidentally
1:49:40
spill your coffee over your sweater you're now in a terrible state you've got to go to an important meeting you run into a store you desperately need
1:49:46
another sweater you can't find a salesperson anywhere very irritating right so what's
1:49:53
different one you didn't want the salesperson and the other one you did want the salesperson anybody have an answer as to why they're different
1:50:00
they are innate they are in need of the salesperson they need that you're right they have a need
1:50:07
um the thing that i believe is really the key is that is that in the one they're actually very early in the buying cycle they don't even have
1:50:13
awareness of what they're trying to buy in the other one they're really far down the purchase cycle and they know exactly
1:50:18
what they want to buy and the mistake that i think most marketers make is thinking that every single person who
1:50:24
comes to their website and that they meet is actually immediately ready to buy so they need to jump straight into
1:50:29
selling to them and they turn them off with this amazingly aggressive pitch to them and it's really the wrong approach
1:50:37
and my personal guess is that 80 percent of the people who come to your website aren't ready to buy and really you have
1:50:42
to do something else to engage them and build a careful and quiet relationship with them and just hope that you are
1:50:49
around at the time when they do actually find that they have that need and are ready to buy it and that's something which i think most marketers make a
1:50:55
terrible mistake of and try to sell too quickly so the other thing that's really
1:51:00
interesting here is the concept of triggers in the buying cycle there are for an awful lot of products like an
1:51:06
antivirus product it's very hard to sell somebody that until they've actually had a virus or until they've read an article
1:51:12
that scared them about a virus or maybe in the case of backup software have you it's hard to sell backup software to
1:51:18
people that haven't actually suffered a loss there's not the motivation there so the triggers that happen and i'd ask you to think about the triggers that
1:51:24
specifically cause your buyers to actually figure out they need your product and the thing i'm going to show you in a
1:51:31
while here is as a marketer can you cause that trigger to happen that's a very powerful thing if you can because
1:51:38
if you if you're able to make that happen you can move them out of a very simple interest stage and actually into
1:51:44
the point where they have need and want to want to move forward here what is the the things that you do at the two
1:51:50
different stages of the funnel the top of the final stage top of the funnel is really very simple which is this is when
1:51:56
you're dealing with a customer who's who on the farthest left-hand side has no idea that they have a need for your
1:52:01
product and on the farthest right hand side is very clear that they have an exact need for your product and there's a spectrum of gray and white in between
1:52:08
that and there's different activities that you would take but my key thing that i want to get across to you here is that when you finish the top of the
1:52:14
funnel what you want to be doing i believe is driving them to your website and when you get them to your website
1:52:20
you want to get their email address from them because if you don't have their email address or some other connection with them
1:52:26
you cannot continue to stay in touch with them and continue to to build a relationship with them there so
1:52:32
once you've gone through that stage there you're going to the next phase which i think is the middle of the funnel and the middle of the funnel is
1:52:38
pretty straightforward it's really about determining which people are actually ready to buy and putting attention and
1:52:44
focus on them with the qualification phase and those who are not you stick into a big lead nurturing bucket and you
1:52:52
want software like hubspot to help you run this and basically the art of doing great lead nurturing
1:52:58
is to get very good at segmenting your customers down because the open rates on emails that are generic and broad across
1:53:05
the whole base will be very low but if you can pick people that are in very specific verticals and send them an
1:53:10
email saying i know you're a photography company here's how we solve problems for photographers that does very well and
1:53:17
similarly for example if you've got somebody who's doing a free trial of your product and you know by using um
1:53:24
tracking of which things they've used and which things they haven't used that they've used this feature but not that
1:53:29
feature you want to send them an email which says hey i see you've experienced this part of our product but i would like to encourage
1:53:36
you to to look at this and here's a video which shows you the benefits of that and here's how to get into it so that's about where they are in the usage
1:53:42
of your product where they are in the sales cycle so being able to segment building up a database that shows you not only the attributes
1:53:49
of the person but also all of the things that they've done have they been to your website were they on the page where for
1:53:55
example the pricing is the pricing page is a good indicator that for example they're ready to buy
1:54:01
were they on the technical pages that tells you that they're a technical buyer were they on the pages that have got all
1:54:06
the customer testimonials that probably tells you they're a business buyer so you treat them differently send them different emails based on that kind of
1:54:12
information there if you get to this point here of having a funnel set up one
1:54:19
of the key things that we will have done is created a series of steps each step
1:54:24
will actually be trying to address one of these questions that they they had to have addressed when you were
1:54:30
asking the question why they didn't buy with the single page website then so what we want to do is
1:54:37
uh for the metrics here i'm just going to give you a very simple concept of how to design your metrics for a funnel
1:54:43
you're going to measure how many people were in each step and also
1:54:48
when you finished that step how many people converted to the next step michael was 100 right one of the key
1:54:54
things that i discover when i walk into most companies is that they haven't connected their activities together so
1:55:00
they didn't make a link between the webinar that they held and what they want to do next
1:55:05
so we are i assume here designing a completely linked series of actions so
1:55:11
when they come out of one they're going to go straight into the next and you want to measure how many actually did convert there so let's take a very simple funnel
1:55:18
and show you what that might look like assuming here that we've got visitors coming to a website and we want to convert those into a trial and out of
1:55:25
the trial we're hoping that they're going to convert into a closed deal so in that particular case what we want
1:55:32
is how many visitors have we got and we want a trend line showing us that hopefully that's going up and to the
1:55:37
right a trend line of how many trials we've got again hopefully going up and to the right and a trend line of how
1:55:42
many closed deals and then we want the conversion rate from visitors to trials and the
1:55:47
conversion rate from uh trials to close deals so that's the pretty simple way to tell you how to design your metrics for
1:55:53
your funnel and this is one last thing here is you want the overall conversion rate and the reason
1:55:59
for this is that different lead sources have very different conversion rates so your facebook ads for example might be
1:56:05
completely different to your inbound marketing leads and you need to know that because some of them are going to be good investments and and give you a
1:56:12
good payback and others won't so these metrics will help tell you which is working which is not working
1:56:18
now once you've got these metrics in place you will find that every funnel even cisco microsoft oracle etc have
1:56:25
blockage points where their funnels aren't working the way that they hope they will do all right so i found i
1:56:30
spend a lot of time and have a ton of fun going around at companies and talking to them about
1:56:35
their blockage points i spent three hours with one of my portfolio companies doing that just before i came here and what i've discovered is that the the
1:56:42
key thing is you want your customers to do something you designed your funnel the way you
1:56:48
wanted it to work and the customers are not motivated to do what you wanted them to do
1:56:53
so the step you're asking them for the classic step everybody wants is you want them to come to your website
1:57:00
well they don't really have a reason why they want to come to your website you've got to give them a good reason why they want to come to your website once you've
1:57:06
got them to the website you want their email address how many of you like giving email addresses to websites this
1:57:12
man's shaking his head aggressively here i think most of you feel the same way why you're worried about getting spam right
1:57:18
you hate getting spam email so what we're looking at here
1:57:24
maybe give you an example of a investment that i made a long time ago any of you heard of a company called jboss at all
1:57:30
a few of you have yeah it's an open source java application server and they had when i first ran into them
1:57:38
had not five million downloads of this take place and when i went with them they had a
1:57:44
business selling documentation for twenty seven thousand dollars a month and they were also selling training for
1:57:50
it so they were making a couple hundred thousand dollars a quarter with this business and they had a new idea about selling support contracts and i was
1:57:57
brought in to kind of look at how do we market this what do we do to create these steps here so the first thing i
1:58:03
said to them is where the names of the five million people that downloaded this thing because we want to talk to them
1:58:08
and they told me that they tried putting an email form in front of that download and it had cut the download rate by a
1:58:15
factor of 10. so that really clearly brings out you know nobody wants to give their email address there so what we did
1:58:21
was pretty simple this is the thing that michael's talked about a little bit but i have a slightly
1:58:26
different way of describing it we looked at on this blockage point here there are
1:58:31
two key elements that stop people from doing things one of them is friction and the second one is what are their
1:58:37
concerns and what we have to do as marketers is come up with a really super strong
1:58:44
motivation that is more powerful than the resistance that they have the friction that they have and the concerns
1:58:49
that they have we've got to answer their concerns as well sometimes it's just a matter of telling them that you're not going to spam them and giving them some
1:58:54
assurance that they won't have problems but the art here is is getting
1:59:00
inside of the customer's head and understanding what's going on in their brain and recognizing
1:59:07
other things about them so a little example here is if you want somebody to come to your website
1:59:12
and you don't want to annoy them straight away with selling you need to attract them there with something interesting to them and so the answer to
1:59:20
that is get inside of their heads understand the things like what does their boss expect of them at the end of
1:59:25
every quarter how do they get graded for good marks if their boss thinks they've done a great job
1:59:30
or what do they what do they personally worry about most and maybe use those things
1:59:36
that are inside of their brain not your brain as to what you want to have happen to create the incentives for them here
1:59:42
so i'm going to quickly illustrate what we did with jboss was pretty straightforward we took the documentation that they were selling for
1:59:48
27 000. after three months of arguing with them to give it away free they finally gave
1:59:53
it away three and it turned on a lead flow of 10 000 leads per month for them which uh created another problem which
1:59:59
is that's too many leads for most salespeople to handle but at least it was a a huge start and this basically fueled the whole business uh from that
2:00:06
point onwards there so the documentation was an adequate motivation to overcome the concern about
2:00:12
spam there let's have a look at another really good one here which is getting traffic to your website and here i'm
2:00:17
going to use bran as an example this is the predecessor to what currently exists which is marketing
2:00:23
grader hubspot put up this this site called website grader and it's very cool
2:00:29
because all you have to do is literally put in your url for your company name
2:00:34
and then if you want to put in the competitors names and then this thing would run away for a short while and it
2:00:39
would spit out an analysis of why your site was good or not good at search engine optimization
2:00:46
and the other clever thing about it is it would put a score there now i have to say that my website which is what was
2:00:51
graded here got 95 but almost nobody gets 95 the typical score is about 50 to 55 or so
2:00:57
and let's go through why does this work well the first thing that's really interesting about this
2:01:03
is this is a free application that gives you a lot of value so
2:01:08
because it's free you spread it virally you tell other people about the thing and it gets an awful lot of interest
2:01:14
from from your friends as well the second thing that's cool about this is it starts to um present the fact that
2:01:21
you're an expert in your field so trust somebody mentioned trust was very important before you buy from somebody
2:01:28
within seconds flat this has started to create trust that hubspot is a company that knows what it's talking about
2:01:34
and then the other thing that i love about this is the score is actually a trigger because if you're
2:01:39
like most americans and you get a score of 55 you want to improve it so the first question going through your mind
2:01:45
is well what step next should i take to get a better score and by the way i think this concept is very usable in
2:01:52
almost all businesses which is you can grade a lot of the things that you're selling you can tell the customer you're
2:01:57
not up to speed with the best practices in your particular industry and here's why and that is an inspiration to cause
2:02:04
them to feel like they need to do something about it particularly if they feel like there's a chance their boss might find out that they haven't got the
2:02:09
best score around and that that might be a problem for them later on there so in essence the quick lessons from that
2:02:17
low customer work high value score leverages the trigger builds trust through a clear
2:02:23
demonstration of expertise the last thing that i love about this is that this is the notion of using engineering
2:02:29
for marketing and i really think this is an incredibly important thing for many of you because a lot of you have developers in your
2:02:36
organizations and developers can build much more valuable things that cause an attraction for customers than marketers
2:02:43
can marketers are stuck with things like white papers and videos and stuff like that so we're thinking about when you're considering
2:02:49
this is bring your engineering team in on this problem and have them consider it as well so the art of doing this well is to
2:02:58
even go down to microsteps a little tiny example i'll give you here i was sitting with a company called fetchnotes that's
2:03:03
a techstars company and i like the entrepreneur there a lot so i was telling him you know to to give
2:03:09
me the diagram of his viral loop that he was trying to create and the first thing he said was okay so somebody downloads
2:03:14
this app um by the way fetchnotes is just a simple to-do list app on your on your iphone your first thing you get them to do is
2:03:21
put in a to-do list item but his problem is that he wants you to use some special features in his product which is to tag
2:03:27
that to-do list item and the issue there immediately with that very first step is
2:03:32
most people are not used to tagging their to-do list items and they don't really see why they should because there's no benefit apparent to them yet
2:03:39
so my thought for him on that one was where your friction is that there's they don't know they don't know how to do it and they
2:03:45
don't know why they should do it so what you need to do is put in-app um messaging so that you can pick up on the
2:03:51
fact that they've entered a to-do list item but not entered a tag and put up a little message which says here's why you
2:03:57
should tag and here's what the benefits are once they've done a couple of entries then you want to show them the next
2:04:03
thing which is when they get the wow moment which is to click on a filtered list of to-do list items which is get me
2:04:08
my work phone calls which is two tags work tag and a phone calls tag and
2:04:14
that's the moment when the customer gets the wow moment where they're excited about this product and suddenly see some
2:04:19
benefit from it so what we're doing there is we're micro analyzing each step of your trial breaking them down looking
2:04:25
at the friction for them looking at why there's a motivation for somebody to go to the next stage why there's a problem for them go to the next stage and also
2:04:32
particularly looking at when do they get the real moment of realization that this trial was successful what did it need to
2:04:38
take for me to feel like this was a successful trial i will now continue to use this product and recommend it to others then
2:04:44
so that's my real my real pitch to you here is map out your process from start to finish take that one website where
2:04:51
people would have purchased in one thing figure out the series of mini steps and for each mini step connect them to the
2:04:57
next mini step and sit and analyze what the friction is and the concerns are write those down and the moment you
2:05:03
write them down this is a funny thing i've i've gotten a lot of people to solve the problem the second they put
2:05:09
these things down because they immediately realized ah we could do that to solve that issue or we could make that a lot easier if we simply but
2:05:17
they're carrying them around in their head and they think they've done the best they can do but the moment i make
2:05:22
them write them down magic happens so there's the the short amount that i can get covered
2:05:28
in this amount of time here and thanks so much for your time and attention
2:05:36
thanks so much david one of the things that's exciting is to hear that being thought about in a way that i think everybody could approach those various
2:05:42
different steps and i love this last point because um i guess we must be brothers we think similarly here on this
2:05:48
one but this is exactly what we were talking about when we did the slippery products analysis which is how do you make the product simple low cost initial
2:05:54
prove value quickly etc all those other steps and i couldn't agree more it's an easy way for startups to make a big impact in the go to market so great
2:06:01
stuff there are a lot of great slides that david didn't have chance to cover um so i'm going to encourage two things
2:06:07
one is first of all these are all up on the site but also he has a great site great blog called for entrepreneurs.com which
2:06:13
i encourage you to visit has a lot of other great materials on this whole subject so we're at the end of our agenda you will be extremely patient this evening
2:06:20
and i just want to quickly you know recap by making sure you know this is a big subject and we tried to cover some
2:06:26
of the key points on it but obviously that we couldn't cover absolutely everything in the marketing and sales cycle and all the different strategies
2:06:32
and tactics you could take we picked off a few key ones and we ended with the whole discussion about how could you
2:06:38
make it all measurable so that you could actually drive this the ones that we didn't cover have been covered in previous classes before
2:06:44
and for those of you who didn't get it i encourage you to come and ask me or that or harvard has them here's the handout
2:06:49
and again you can just go straight to the website if you want to get it and it'll have all those other case studies on things like channel and
2:06:55
distribution for example which is a big one and one of the most important things that you can drive as a multiplier
2:07:00
and i have had a bunch of requests from you which i'll get to i've got a series of classes coming up in the spring
2:07:06
people have asked me to connect the dots with the business model they want to talk about whole products strategic partnering so have those case studies
2:07:11
lined up for the spring for those of you want to follow along and there'll be a sign up form for those uh if you just ask either myself or jody
2:07:18
so to summarize the key points to remember from this evening are specifically think about managing your
2:07:24
brand right from the start that's about you and if you start how you mean to end that'll make a big difference position
2:07:29
to be unique we talked about some of the ways to do that not just technology we talked about how important it is to
2:07:34
target and segment and as you could hear from david and brian and actually mark talking about that that's a critical
2:07:40
piece there's a good case study that actually jamis did with demandware about how we did that that's on the website
2:07:45
and think about driving your marketing and sales cycle we heard some wonderful examples here of how you can do this in such a disruptive way with inbound
2:07:52
marketing in a much more appropriate way for startups than just bludgeoning your customers with heavy expensive sales
2:07:58
calls and outbound approaches so i think that was very exciting and thank you uh both david and brian and and mark uh for
2:08:05
bringing that to life and jameis in particular for for bringing this to uh into focus in terms of how we position
2:08:10
correctly with the right brand but it is ultimately about measuring so if there were one takeaway i'd ask you
2:08:15
to do this is the one discipline that typically gets lost it's think about how to get results-oriented measured
2:08:21
execution and drive that through iteration in your uh your early days as a startup very few
2:08:27
people benchmark early on this and the earlier you benchmark the more you'll build confidence yourself and for everybody you want to attract into your
2:08:32
business to work with this and the more easy it will be for example to attract funding and so just to put this all in
2:08:38
perspective you know this whole series is about building an enduring company go to market is we believe one of the most
2:08:43
important aspects of execution you can hire the right team you can have a great value prop you can have a fantastic
2:08:49
vision but if you don't start executing and connecting with your customers and actually build this piece right everything frankly falls apart so thank
2:08:56
you very much to our guests who have been so generous with their time and putting these resources
2:09:02
together and also thanks to the harvard ilab for what's been a tremendous year uh to all
2:09:08
the team here who supported this we'll be back next year uh thanks to all your interests and support for that and uh
2:09:13
have a great evening and please come and join our guests up the front to ask any more questions appreciate your time
