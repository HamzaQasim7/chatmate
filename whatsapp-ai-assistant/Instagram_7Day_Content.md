## DAY 1: STAGE
### Theme: *"The Message You're Still Staring At"*

**Content Type:** Carousel (5 slides)

| Slide | Text |
|-------|------|
| 1 | "You've been staring at this message for 7 minutes." |
| 2 | "Too formal? Too casual? Too pushy? Too cold?" |
| 3 | "The average professional sends 50-100 messages daily" |
| 4 | "That's 50-100 chances to sound wrong." |
| 5 | "What if there was a better way?" |

**Caption:**
```
We've all been there.

That client message sitting in your WhatsApp.
That lead waiting in your Slack.

Too formal → sounds robotic
Too casual → sounds unprofessional
Too pushy → kills the deal

Sound familiar? Drop a 😩 if you've been there.

Tomorrow: Why this problem is WORSE than you think.

**Stories:** Poll - "How long do you stare at important messages before hitting send?"

## DAY 2: TENSION
### Theme: *"The Real Cost of Message Anxiety"*

**Content Type:** Reel (30-60 seconds)

**Script:**
```
[HOOK] "This is what happens when you send the wrong message..."

[TENSION]
"Too casual with a client? They question your professionalism."
"Too pushy with a lead? They ghost you."
"Too stiff with a supporter? They leave a bad review."

[TWIST]
"Every day, you're making 50-100 tone decisions.
ONE wrong tone can cost you a deal, a client, a reputation."

[CLIFFHANGER]
"But what if you had 6 experts helping you get it right?"
"Tomorrow."
```

**Caption:**
```
Every message is a micro-negotiation.
Every tone choice shapes perception.
Every word you send IS your brand.

→ 60% of customers expect response within 1 hour
→ 35% of deals die from slow/poor follow-ups
→ 1 wrong tone can undo months of relationship building

Tomorrow: The solution exists. And it has 6 experts.

## DAY 5: TRUST
### Theme: *"Why We Built This"*

**Content Type:** Single Image + Long Caption

**Caption:**
```
Real talk: We built Reple because WE had the problem.

As freelancers and founders, we were drowning in messages.
Every message felt like a test:
"Did I sound professional enough?"
"Was that too pushy?"

We tried templates. Too rigid.
We tried AI tools. Too generic.

So we asked: What if AI could learn SIX distinct communication styles?

That's why every tone in Reple is purpose-built:
→ Formal: Trained on executive communication
→ Sales Expert: Trained on persuasion psychology
→ Negotiator: Trained on strategic diplomacy

Built by people who understand message anxiety.
For people who never want to feel it again.
