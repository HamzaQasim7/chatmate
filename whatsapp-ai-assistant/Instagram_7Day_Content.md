## 5. Growth Strategy (The Secret Sauce)
1.  **Engage with "Reply Guys":** Go to big sales influencers' accounts (e.g., Alex Hormozi, Grant Cardone). When people ask questions in comments, reply with genuine advice and say "I use a tool to help draft these..."
2.  **Stories are for Sales:** Use Reels for reach, but use Stories to sell. Post a daily "Win" (e.g., "Just booked a meeting using Rainmaker tone!") with a Link Sticker.
3.  **Collaborate:** DM small productivity creators (1k-10k followers). Offer them a **free Lifetime Pro** account if they make one video about Reple.
